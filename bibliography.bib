abstract = {Attempts have been made to treat nonsense-associated genetic disorders by chemical agents and hence an improved mechanistic insight into the decoding of readthrough signals is essential for the identification and characterisation of factors for the treatment of these disorders. To identify either novel compounds or genes that modulate translation readthrough, we have employed dual reporter-based high-throughput screens that use enzymatic and fluorescence activities and screened bioactive National Institute of Neurological Disease Syndrome (NINDS) compounds (n = 1000) and siRNA (n = 288) libraries. Whilst siRNAs targeting kinases such as CSNK1G3 and NME3 negatively regulate readthrough, neither the bioactive NINDS compounds nor PTC124 promote readthrough. Of note, PTC124 has previously been shown to promote readthrough. Furthermore, the impacts of G418 on the components of eukaryotic selenocysteine incorporation machinery have also been investigated. The selenocysteine machinery decodes the stop codon UGA specifying selenocysteine in natural selenoprotein genes. We have found that the eukaryotic SelC gene promotes the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS)-mediated readthrough but inhibits the readthrough activity induced by G418. We have previously reported that SECIS-mediated readthrough at UGA codons follows a non-processive mechanism. Here, we show that G418-mediated promotion of readthrough also occurs through a non-processive mechanism which competes with translation termination. Based on our observations, we suggest that proteins generated through a non-processive mechanism may be therapeutically beneficial for the resolution of nonsense-associated genetic disorders.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  {\&}  Francis Group. Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one of the most common genetically-acquired life-limiting conditions worldwide. The underlying defect is dysfunction of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane-conductance regulator (CFTR) which leads to progressive lung disease and other multi-system effects. Around 10{\%} of people with CF have a class I nonsense mutation that leads to production of shortened CFTR due to a premature termination codon (PTC). Areas covered: We discuss the discovery of the small-molecule drug ataluren, which in vitro has been shown to allow read-through of PTCs and facilitate synthesis of full-length protein. We review clinical studies that have been performed involving ataluren in CF. Early-phase short-term cross-over studies showed improvement in nasal potential difference. A follow-up phase III randomised controlled trial did not show a significant difference for the primary outcome of lung function, however a post-hoc analysis suggested possible benefit in patients not receiving tobramycin. A further randomised controlled trial in patients not receiving tobramycin has been reported as showing no benefit but has not yet been published in full peer-reviewed form. Expert opinion: A small-molecule approach to facilitate read-through of PTCs in nonsense mutations makes intuitive sense. However, at present there is no high-quality evidence of clinical efficacy for ataluren in people with CF.},

abstract = {Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is the most common fatal human genetic disease, which is caused by a defect in an anion channel protein (CFTR) that affects ion and water transport across the epithelium. We devised an apparatus to enable the measurement of concentration changes of sodium, potassium, chloride, pH, and transepithelial potential difference by means of ion-selective electrodes that were placed on both sides of a 16HBE14$\sigma$ human bronchial epithelial cell line that was grown on a porous support. Using flat miniaturized ISE electrodes allows for reducing the medium volume adjacent to cells to approximately 20 $\mu$L and detecting changes in ion concentrations that are caused by transport through the cell layer. In contrast to classic electrochemical measurements, in our experiments neither the calibration of electrodes nor the interpretation of results is simple. The calibration solutions might affect cell physiology, the medium composition might change the direction of actions of the membrane channels and transporters, and water flow that might trigger or cut off the transport pathways accompanies the transport of ions. We found that there is an electroneutral transport of sodium chloride in both directions of the cell monolayer in the isosmotic transepithelial concentration gradient of sodium or chloride ions. The ions and water are transported as an isosmotic solution of 145 mM of NaCl.},

There was an overlapping spectrum of ion channel measurements among the men with CBAVD, ranging from values in the control and obligate heterozygote range at one extreme, to values in the CF range at the other. All pancreatic-sufficient patients with CF and 34 of 36 patients with CBAVD with mutations on both alleles carried at least one mild mutation. However, the distribution of mild mutations in the two groups differed greatly.

Here we report that apical addition of amphotericin B, a small molecule that forms unselective ion channels, restored HCO3− secretion and increased airway surface liquid pH in cultured airway epithelia from people with cystic fibrosis. These effects required the basolateral Na+, K+-ATPase, indicating that apical amphotericin B channels functionally interfaced with this driver of anion secretion. Amphotericin B also restored airway surface liquid pH, viscosity, and antibacterial activity in primary cultures of airway epithelia from people with cystic fibrosis caused by different mutations, including ones that do not yield CFTR, and increased airway surface liquid pH in CFTR-null pigs in vivo. Thus, unselective small-molecule ion channels can restore host defences in cystic fibrosis airway epithelia via a mechanism that is independent of CFTR and is therefore independent of genotype.},

abstract = {Background: Cell-based studies have shown that W1282X generates a truncated protein that can be functionally augmented by modulators. However, modulator treatment of primary cells from individuals who carry two copies of W1282X generates no functional CFTR. To understand the lack of response to modulators, we investigated the effect of W1282X on CFTR RNA transcript levels. Methods: qRT-PCR and RNA-seq were performed on primary nasal epithelial (NE) cells of a previously studied individual who is homozygous for W1282X, her carrier parents and control individuals without nonsense variants in CFTR. Results: CFTR RNA bearing W1282X in NE cells shows a steady-state level of 4.2 ± 0.9{\%} of wild-type (WT) CFTR RNA in the mother and 12.4 ± 1.3{\%} in the father. NMDI14, an inhibitor of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD), restored W1282X mRNA to almost 50{\%} of WT levels in the parental NE cells. RNA-seq of the NE cells homozygous for W1282X showed that CFTR transcript level was reduced to 1.7{\%} of WT (p-value: 4.6e-3). Negligible truncated CFTR protein was generated by Flp-In 293 cells stably expressing the W1282X EMG even though CFTR transcript was well above levels observed in the parents and proband. Finally, we demonstrated that NMD inhibition improved the stability and response to correctors of W1282X-CFTR protein expressed in the Flp-In-293 cells. Conclusion: These results show that W1282X can cause substantial degradation of CFTR mRNA that has to be addressed before efforts aimed at augmenting CFTR protein function can be effective.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common recessive autosomal disease among Caucasians, is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The most common mutation, F508del, leads to CFTR impaired plasma membrane trafficking. Therapies modulating CFTR basic defect are emerging, such as VX-809, a corrector of F508del-CFTR traffic which just succeeded in a Phase III clinical trial. We recently showed that VX-809 is additive to two other correctors (VRT-325 and compound 4a). Here, we aimed to determine whether the differential rescuing by these compounds results from cell-specific factors or rather from distinct effects at the early biogenesis and/or processing. The rescuing efficiencies of the above three correctors were first compared in different cellular models (primary respiratory cells, cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial and baby hamster kidney [BHK] cell lines) by functional approaches: micro-Ussing chamber and iodide efflux. Next, biochemical methods (metabolic labeling, pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation) were used to determine their impact on CFTR biogenesis / processing. Functional analyses revealed that VX-809 has the greatest rescuing efficacy and that the relative efficiencies of the three compounds are essentially maintained in all three cellular models tested. Nevertheless, biochemical data show that VX-809 significantly stabilizes F508del-CFTR immature form, an effect that is not observed for C3 nor C4. VX-809 and C3 also significantly increase accumulation of immature CFTR. Our data suggest that VX-809 increases the stability of F508del-CFTR immature form at an early phase of its biogenesis, thus explaining its increased efficacy when inducing its rescue.},

abstract = {Abstract A major challenge in cystic fibrosis (CF) research is applying mutation-specific therapy to individual patients with diverse and rare CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) genotypes. Read-through agents are currently the most promising approach for Class I mutations that introduce premature termination codons (PTCs) into CFTR mRNA. However, variations in degradation of PTC containing transcripts by nonsense mediated decay (NMD) might lower read-through efficacy. Allele specific quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR was used to measure variations in CFTR mRNA abundance for several PTC mutations in respiratory cells and intestinal organoids. The majority of PTC mutations were associated with reduced levels of relative mRNA transcript abundance (?33{\%} and 26{\%} of total CFTR mRNA in respiratory cells and intestinal organoids, respectively, compared to {\textgreater}50{\%} for non-PTC causing mutations). These levels were generally not affected by PTC mutation type or position, but there could be twofold variations between individuals bearing the same genotype. Most PTC mutations in CFTR are subject to similar levels of NMD, which reduce but do not abolish PTC bearing mRNAs. Measurement of individual NMD levels in intestinal organoids and HNE cells might, therefore, be useful in predicting efficacy of PTC read-through in the context of personalized CFTR modulator therapy.},

The study population included 78 individuals with no prior diagnosis of CF. Evaluation of bronchial epithelial cells (obtained by bronchoscopy) revealed that exon 9 was variably deleted in all individuals. Remarkably, there were four individuals, all greater than or equal to 35 yr, in whom bronchial epithelial cells exhibited 73, 89, 90, and 92{\%} CFTR transcripts with inframe deletion of exon 9, respectively, despite normal sweat Cl- and no clinical manifestation of CF. In the context that only 8{\%} or less of bronchial CFTR transcripts need exon 9 to maintain normal airway function, these observations strongly suggest that either exon 9 is not necessary for CFTR structure and/or function or that only a very small fraction of bronchial epithelial cells need to express normal CFTR mRNA transcripts with exon 9 to perform the function of CFTR sufficient to maintain a normal phenotype in vivo.},

abstract = {The 5-thymidine (5T) variant of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) intron 8 polypyrimidine tract (IVS8-T tract) is the most frequent CFTR gene alteration identified in men with congenital bilateral absence of vas deferens (CBAVD). This alternative splicing variant gives rise to two transcripts, one normal with exon 9 intact and the other with in-frame deletion of exon 9. That CBAVD men usually have none of the other clinical signs of classical cystic fibrosis (CF) suggests less functional CFTR is produced in the reproductive tract than in other CF-associated organs. Nasal epithelia and segments of vas deferens were obtained from healthy, previously vasectomized men who presented for vasectomy reversal. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed on these specimens, with the region of CFTR cDNA spanning exon 9 amplified. For both nasal and vasal tissues, a strong positive correlation was found between the length of the IVS8-T tract and the proportion of mRNA with exon 9 intact. In addition, within the same subject, a significantly higher level of transcripts lacking exon 9 was found in vas deferens than nasal epithelia, regardless of the IVS8-T genotype. These findings suggest that the splicing of CFTR precursor mRNA is less efficient in vasal epithelia compared with respiratory epithelia. Thus, differential splicing efficiency between the various tissues which express CFTR provides one possible explanation for the reproductive tract abnormalities observed in infertile men with CFTR gene alterations but without other clinical manifestations of CF.},

abstract = {Only about 30{\%} of the cystic fibrosis chromosomes in the Israeli cystic fibrosis patient populations carry the major CF mutation (delta F508). Since different Jewish ethnic groups tended to live as closed isolates until recent times, high frequencies of specific mutations are expected among the remainder cystic fibrosis chromosomes of these ethnic groups. Genetic factors appear to influence the severity of the disease. It is therefore expected that different mutations will be associated with either severe or mild phenotype. Direct genomic sequencing of exons included in the two nucleotide-binding folds of the putative CFTR protein was performed on 119 Israeli cystic fibrosis patients from 97 families. One sequence alteration which is expected to create a termination at residue 1282 (W1282X) was found in 63 chromosomes. Of 95 chromosomes, 57 (60{\%}) are of Ashkenazi origin. Together with the delta F508 (23{\%} in this group), G542X, N1303K, and 1717-1G----A mutations, the identification of 92{\%} of cystic fibrosis chromosomes of Ashkenazi origin becomes possible. Patients homozygous for the W1282X mutation (n = 16) and patients heterozygous for the delta F508 and W1282X mutations (n = 22) had similarly severe disease, reflected by pancreatic insufficiency, high incidence of meconium ileus (37{\%} and 27{\%}, respectively), early age at diagnosis, poor nutritional status, and variable pulmonary function. In conclusion, the W1282X mutation is the most common cystic fibrosis mutation in the Ashkenazi Jewish patient population in Israel. This nonsense mutation is associated with presentation of severe disease.},

abstract = {The effect of nonsense mutations on mRNA levels is variable. The levels of some mRNAs are not affected and truncated proteins are produced, while the levels of others are severely decreased and null phenotypes are observed. The effect on mRNA levels is important for the understanding of phenotype-genotype association. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal autosomal recessive disease with variable clinical presentation. Recently, two CF patients with mild pulmonary disease carrying nonsense mutations (R553X, W1316X) were found to have severe deficiency of mRNA. In the Jewish Ashkenazi CF patient population, 60{\%} of the chromosomes carry a nonsense mutation, W1282X. Patients homozygous for this mutation have severe disease presentation with variable pulmonary disease. The presence of CF transcripts in a group of patients homozygous and heterozygous for this mutation was studied by reverse transcriptase PCR of various regions of the gene. Subsequent hybridization to specific CF PCR probes and densitometry analysis indicated that the CF mRNA levels in patients homozygous for the W1282X mutation are not significantly decreased by the mutation. mRNA levels were compared for patients heterozygous for the W1282X mutation. The relative levels of mRNA with the W1282X, and the delta F508 or the normal alleles, were similar in each patient. These results indicate that the severe clinical phenotype of patients carrying the W1282X mutation is not due to a severe deficiency of mRNA. In addition, the severity, progression, and variability of the pulmonary disease are affected by other, as yet unknown factors.},

Here, we demonstrate that mild inhibition of translation results in a dramatic and disproportional reduction in production of misfolded polypeptides in mammalian cells, suggesting an improved folding of newly synthesized proteins. Indeed, inhibition of translation elongation, which slightly attenuated levels of a copepod GFP mutant protein, significantly enhanced its function. In contrast, inhibition of translation initiation had minimal effects on copepod GFP folding. On the other hand, mild suppression of either translation elongation or initiation corrected folding defects of the disease-associated cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutant F508del. We propose that modulation of translation can be used as a novel approach to improve overall proteostasis in mammalian cells, as well as functions of disease-associated mutant proteins with folding deficiencies.},

To expand treatment eligibility, we stably expressed 43 rare missense CFTR variants associated with moderate CF from a single site in the genome of human CF bronchial epithelial (CFBE41o-) cells. The magnitude of drug response was highly correlated with residual CFTR function for the potentiator ivacaftor, the corrector lumacaftor, and ivacaftor-lumacaftor combination therapy. Response of a second set of 16 variants expressed stably in Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells showed nearly identical correlations. Subsets of variants were identified that demonstrated statistically significantly higher responses to specific treatments. Furthermore, nearly all variants studied in CFBE cells (40 of 43) and FRT cells (13 of 16) demonstrated greater response to ivacaftor-lumacaftor combination therapy than either modulator alone. Together, these variants represent 87{\%} of individuals in the CFTR2 database with at least 1 missense variant. Thus, our results indicate that most individuals with CF carrying missense variants are (a) likely to respond modestly to currently available modulator therapy, while a small fraction will have pronounced responses, and (b) likely to derive the greatest benefit from combination therapy.},

Recent advances in medicinal chemistry have increased drug potency and enhanced delivery and distribution to a broad array of tissue and cell types. A key advantage of nucleic acid therapeutics is in their application to monogenic diseases. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is one such disease that affects approximately 70,000 people globally. This severe disease is an excellent candidate for nucleic acid therapies, as it is due to a genetic defect in a single epithelial chloride channel. Although CF affects many tissues, the primary cause of patient mortality is lung disease. Here we review the various nucleic acid therapeutic modalities and their mechanisms of action, the opportunities and challenges associated with application of nucleic acid drugs to the lung pathology of CF, and the current state and prospects for nucleic acid drugs for the treatment of CF.},

abstract = {Mutations in the chloride channel cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) cause cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder characterized by defects in CFTR biosynthesis, localization to the cell surface, or activation by regulatory factors. It was discovered recently that surface localization of CFTR is stabilized by an interaction between the CFTR N terminus and the multidomain cytoskeletal protein filamin. The details of the CFTR-filamin interaction, however, are unclear. Using x-ray crystallography, we show how the CFTR N terminus binds to immunoglobulin-like repeat 21 of filamin A (FlnA-Ig21). CFTR binds to beta-strands C and D of FlnA-Ig21 using backbone-backbone hydrogen bonds, a linchpin serine residue, and hydrophobic side-chain packing. We use NMR to determine that the CFTR N terminus also binds to several other immunoglobulin-like repeats from filamin A in vitro. Our structural data explain why the cystic fibrosis-causing S13F mutation disrupts CFTR-filamin interaction. We show that FlnA-Ig repeats transfected into cultured Calu-3 cells disrupt CFTR-filamin interaction and reduce surface levels of CFTR. Our findings suggest that filamin A stabilizes surface CFTR by anchoring it to the actin cytoskeleton through interactions with multiple filamin Ig repeats. Such an interaction mode may allow filamins to cluster multiple CFTR molecules and to promote colocalization of CFTR and other filamin-binding proteins in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells.},

abstract = {Despite hope that a cure was imminent when the causative gene was cloned nearly 30 years ago, cystic fibrosis (CF [MIM: 219700]) remains a life-shortening disease affecting more than 70 000 individuals worldwide. However, within the last 6 years the Food and Drug Administration's approval of Ivacaftor, the first drug that corrects the defective cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein [CFTR (MIM: 602421)] in patients with the G551D mutation, marks a watershed in the development of novel therapeutics for this devastating disease. Here we review recent progress in diverse research areas, which all focus on curing CF at the genetic, biochemical or physiological level. In the near future it seems probable that development of mutation-specific therapies will be the focus, since it is unlikely that any one approach will be efficient in correcting the more than 2000 disease-associated variants. We discuss the new drugs and combinations of drugs that either enhance delivery of misfolded CFTR protein to the cell membrane, where it functions as an ion channel, or that activate channel opening. Next we consider approaches to correct the causative genetic lesion at the DNA or RNA level, through repressing stop mutations and nonsense-mediated decay, modulating splice mutations, fixing errors by gene editing or using novel routes to gene replacement. Finally, we explore how modifier genes, loci elsewhere in the genome that modify CF disease severity, may be used to restore a normal phenotype. Progress in all of these areas has been dramatic, generating enthusiasm that CF may soon become a broadly treatable disease.},

abstract = {(2018) The Importance of Aquaporin 1 in Pancreatitis and Its Relation to the CFTR Cl − Channel. Front. Physiol. 9:854. Aquaporins (AQPs) facilitate the transepithelial water flow involved in epithelial fluid secretion in numerous tissues; however, their function in the pancreas is less characterized. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a serious disorder in which specific treatment is still not possible. Accumulating evidence indicate that decreased pancreatic ductal fluid secretion plays an essential role in AP; therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the physiological and pathophysiological role of AQPs in the pancreas. Expression and localization of AQPs were investigated by real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry, whereas osmotic transmembrane water permeability was estimated by the dye dilution technique, in Capan-1 cells. The presence of AQP1 and CFTR in the mice and human pancreas were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Pancreatic ductal HCO 3 − and fluid secretion were studied on pancreatic ducts isolated from wild-type (WT) and AQP1 knock out (KO) mice using microfluorometry and videomicroscopy, respectively. In vivo pancreatic fluid secretion was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. AP was induced by intraperitoneal injection of cerulein and disease severity was assessed by measuring biochemical and histological parameters. In the mice, the presence of AQP1 was detected throughout the whole plasma membrane of the ductal cells and its expression highly depends on the presence of CFTR Cl − channel. In contrast, the expression of AQP1 is mainly localized to the apical membrane of ductal cells in the human pancreas. Bile acid treatment dose-and time-dependently decreased mRNA and protein expression of AQP1 and reduced expression of this channel was also demonstrated in patients suffering from acute and chronic pancreatitis. HCO 3 − and fluid secretion significantly decreased in AQP1 KO versus WT mice and the absence of Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 854 Venglovecz et al. The Role of Aquaporins in Pancreatitis AQP1 also worsened the severity of pancreatitis. Our results suggest that AQP1 plays an essential role in pancreatic ductal fluid and HCO 3 − secretion and decreased expression of the channel alters fluid secretion which probably contribute to increased susceptibility of the pancreas to inflammation.},

abstract = {Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a recently developed technology in which fully differentiated cells such as fibroblasts from individual CF patients can be repaired with [wildtype] CFTR, and reprogrammed to differentiate into fully differentiated cells characteristic of the proximal and distal airways. Here, we review properties of different epithelial cells in the airway, and the in vitro genetic roadmap which iPSCs follow as they are step-wise differentiated into either basal stem cells, for the proximal airway, or into Type II Alveolar cells for the distal airways. The central theme is that iPSC-derived basal stem cells, are penultimately dependent on NOTCH signaling for differentiation into club cells, goblet cells, ciliated cells, and neuroendocrine cells. Furthermore, given the proper matrix, these cellular progenies are also able to self-assemble into a fully functional pseudostratified squamous proximal airway epithelium. By contrast, club cells are reserve stem cells which are able to either differentiate into goblet or ciliated cells, but also to de-differentiate into basal stem cells. Variant club cells, located at the transition between airway and alveoli, may also be responsible for differentiation into Type II Alveolar cells, which then differentiate into Type I Alveolar cells for gas exchange in the distal airway. Using gene editing, the mutant CFTR gene in iPSCs from CF patients can be repaired, and fully functional epithelial cells can thus be generated through directed differentiation. However, there is a limitation in that the lung has other CFTR-dependent cells besides epithelial cells. Another limitation is that there are CFTR-dependent cells in other organs which would continue to contribute to CF disease. Furthermore, there are also bystander or modifier genes which affect disease outcome, not only in the lung, but specifically in other CF-affected organs. Finally, we discuss future personalized applications of the iPSC technology, many of which have already survived the "proof-of-principle" test. These include (i) patient-derived iPSCs used as a "lung-on-a-chip" tool for personalized drug discovery; (ii) replacement of mutant lung cells by wildtype lung cells in the living lung; and (iii) development of bio-artificial lungs. It is hoped that this review will give the reader a roadmap through the most complicated of the obstacles, and foster a guardedly optimistic view of how some of the remaining obstacles might one day be overcome.},

abstract = {The airways of the lung are the primary sites of disease in asthma and cystic fibrosis. Here we study the cellular composition and hierarchy of the mouse tracheal epithelium by single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) and in vivo lineage tracing. We identify a rare cell type, the Foxi1+ pulmonary ionocyte; functional variations in club cells based on their location; a distinct cell type in high turnover squamous epithelial structures that we term ‘hillocks'; and disease-relevant subsets of tuft and goblet cells. We developed ‘pulse-seq', combining scRNA-seq and lineage tracing, to show that tuft, neuroendocrine and ionocyte cells are continually and directly replenished by basal progenitor cells. Ionocytes are the major source of transcripts of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in both mouse (Cftr) and human (CFTR). Knockout of Foxi1 in mouse ionocytes causes loss of Cftr expression and disrupts airway fluid and mucus physiology, phenotypes that are characteristic of cystic fibrosis. By associating cell-type-specific expression programs with key disease genes, we establish a new cellular narrative for airways disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene  can reduce function of the CFTR ion channel activity and impair cellular chloride secretion. The gold standard method to assess CFTR function of ion transport using the Ussing chamber requires a high number of airway epithelial cells grown at air-liquid interface, limiting the application of this method for high throughput screening of potential therapeutic compounds in primary airway epithelial cells (pAECs) featuring less common CFTR mutations. This study assessed an alternative approach, using a small scale halide assay that can be adapted for a personalized high throughput setting to analyze CFTR function of pAEC. METHODS: Pediatric pAECs derived from children with CF (pAECCF) were established and expanded as monolayer cultures, before seeding into 96-well plates for the halide assay. Cells were then transduced with an adenoviral construct containing yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) reporter gene, alone or in combination with either wild-type CFTR (WT-CFTR) or p.Phe508del CFTR. Four days post transduction, cells were stimulated with forskolin and genistein, and assessed for quenching of the eYFP signal following injection of iodide solution into the assay media. RESULTS: Data showed that pAECCF can express eYFP at high efficiency following transduction with the eYFP construct. The halide assay was able to discriminate functional restoration of CFTR in pAECCF treated with either WT-CFTR construct or the positive controls syntaxin 8 and B-cell receptor-associated protein 31 shRNAs. SIGNIFICANCE: The current study demonstrates that the halide assay can be adapted for pediatric pAECCF to evaluate restoration of CFTR function. With the ongoing development of small molecules to modulate the folding and/or activity of various mutated CFTR proteins, this halide assay presents a small-scale personalized screening platform that could assess therapeutic potential of molecules across a broad range of CFTR mutations.},

abstract = {The missing phenylalanine at position 508, located in nucleotide-binding domain (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), is the most common cystic fibrosis mutation. Severe disease-causing mutations also occur in NBD2. To provide information on potential therapeutic strategies for mutations in NBD2, we used a combination of biochemical, cell biological and electrophysiological approaches and newly created cell lines to study two disease-causing NBD2 mutants, N1303K and S1235R. We observed that neither was sensitive to E64, a cysteine protease inhibitor. However, further investigation showed that when treated with a combination of correctors, C4+C18, both mutants also responded to E64. Further exploration to assess aggresome throughput using the autophagy regulator LC3 as a marker showed that, in the absence of correctors, N1303K showed a stalled throughput of LC3-II to the aggresome. The throughput became active again after treatment with the corrector combination C4+C18. Confocal microscopic studies showed that the N1303K and S1235R mutant proteins both co-localized with LC3, but this co-localization was abolished by the corrector combination and, to a lesser extent, by VX-809. Both the corrector combination and VX-809 increased the CFTR chloride channel function of both mutants. We conclude that correctors have a dual effect, particularly on N1303K: they improve trafficking and function at the plasma membrane and reduce the association with autophagosomes. After treatment with correctors persistent degradation by the autophagosome may limit restoration of function. Thus, mutations in NBD2 of CFTR, in contrast to DeltaF508-CFTR, may require additional personalized strategies to rescue them.},

New approaches of genetic engineering with RNA-guided nucleases are rapidly expanding both the potential types of models available and the approaches to correct the CFTR defect. The application of new CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing techniques are similarly increasing capabilities for in vitro modeling of CFTR functions in cell lines and primary cells using air-liquid interface cultures and organoids. Gene editing of CFTR mutations in somatic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells is also transforming gene therapy approaches for CF.

However, the average lifetime of different airway epithelial cell types has not previously been assessed using currently available genetic techniques. Here, we use Cre/loxP genetic technology to indelibly label a random fraction of ciliated cells throughout the airways of a cohort of mice and follow them in vivo for up to 18 mo. We demonstrate that ciliated airway epithelial cells are a terminally differentiated population. Moreover, their average half-life of 6 mo in the trachea and 17 mo in the lung is much longer than previously available estimates, with significant numbers of labeled cells still present after 18 mo. },

abstract = {N-glycosylation, a common cotranslational modification, is thought to be critical for plasma membrane expression of glycoproteins by enhancing protein folding, trafficking, and stability through targeting them to the ER folding cycles via lectin-like chaperones. In this study, we show that N-glycans, specifically core glycans, enhance the productive folding and conformational stability of a polytopic membrane protein, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), independently of lectin-like chaperones. Defective N-glycosylation reduces cell surface expression by impairing both early secretory and endocytic traffic of CFTR. Conformational destabilization of the glycan-deficient CFTR induces ubiquitination, leading to rapid elimination from the cell surface. Ubiquitinated CFTR is directed to lysosomal degradation instead of endocytic recycling in early endosomes mediated by ubiquitin-binding endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) adaptors Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) and TSG101. These results suggest that cotranslational N-glycosylation can exert a chaperone-independent profolding change in the energetic of CFTR in vivo as well as outline a paradigm for the peripheral trafficking defect of membrane proteins with impaired glycosylation.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a chloride channel localized primarily at the apical surface of epithelial cells lining the airway, gut, exocrine glands, etc., where it is responsible for transepithelial salt and water transport. A growing number of proteins have been reported to interact directly or indirectly with CFTR chloride channel, suggesting that CFTR might regulate the activities of other ion channels, receptors, and transporters, in addition to its role as a chloride conductor. Most interactions occur primarily between the opposing terminal tails (N or C) of CFTR and its binding partners, either directly or mediated through various PDZ domain-containing proteins. This chapter describes methods we developed to cross-link CFTR into a macromolecular complex to identify and analyze the assembly and regulation of CFTR-containing complexes in the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR-dependent iodide transport measured by fluorescent quenching of ectopically expressed halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is widely being used to study CFTR function by microscopy or plate readers. Since YFP fluorescence in these systems is dependent on YFP expression levels and iodide concentration, differences in sensor expression level between experimental units are normalized at the start of each experiment. To allow accurate measurement of CFTR function by flow cytometry, we reasoned that co-expression of an iodide insensitive fluorescent protein would allow for normalization of sensor expression levels and more accurate quantification of CFTR function. Our data indicated that dsRed and mKate fluorescence are iodide insensitive, and we determined an optimal format for co-expression of these fluorescent proteins with halide-sensitive YFP. We showed using microscopy that ratiometric measurement (YFP/mKate) corrects for differences in sensor expression levels. Ratiometric measurements were essential to accurately measure CFTR function by flow cytometry that we here describe for the first time. Mixing of wild type or mutant CFTR expressing cells indicated that addition of approximately 10{\%} of wild type CFTR expressing cells could be distinguished by ratiometric YFP quenching. Flow cytometric ratiometric YFP quenching also allowed us to study CFTR mutants associated with differential residual function upon ectopic expression. Compared with conventional plate-bound CFTR function assays, the flow cytometric approach described here can be used to study CFTR function in suspension cells. It may be further adapted to study CFTR function in heterologous cell populations using cell surface markers and selection of cells that display high CFTR function by cell sorting. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

abstract = {The most common cystic fibrosis causing mutation is deletion of phenylalanine at position 508 (F508del), a mutation that leads to protein misassembly with defective processing. Small molecule corrector compounds: VX-809 or Corr-4a (C4) partially restores processing of the major mutant. These two prototypical corrector compounds cause an additive effect on F508del/cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) processing, and hence were proposed to act through distinct mechanisms: VX-809 stabilizing the first membrane-spanning domain (MSD) 1, and C4 acting on the second half of the molecule [consisting of MSD2 and/or nucleotide binding domain (NBD) 2]. We confirmed the effect of VX-809 in enhancing the stability of MSD1 and showed that it also allosterically modulates MSD2 when coexpressed with MSD1. We showed for the first time that C4 stabilizes the second half of the CFTR protein through its action on MSD2. Given the allosteric effect of VX-809 on MSD2, we were prompted to test the hypothesis that the two correctors interact in the full-length mutant protein. We did see evidence supporting their interaction in the full-length F508del-CFTR protein bearing secondary mutations targeting domain:domain interfaces. Disruption of the MSD1:F508del-NBD1 interaction (R170G) prevented correction by both compounds, pointing to the importance of this interface in processing. On the other hand, stabilization of the MSD2:F508del-NBD1 interface (by introducing R1070W) led to a synergistic effect of the compound combination on the total abundance of both the immature and mature forms of the protein. Together, these findings suggest that the two correctors interact in stabilizing the complex of MSDs in F508del-CFTR.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Journal of Visualized Experiments. All rights reserved. While the introduction of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs has revolutionized care in Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the genotype-directed therapy model currently in use has several limitations. First, rare or understudied mutation groups are excluded from definitive clinical trials. Moreover, as additional modulator drugs enter the market, it will become difficult to optimize the modulator choices for an individual subject. Both of these issues are addressed with the use of patient-derived, individualized preclinical model systems of CFTR function and modulation. Human nasal epithelial cells (HNEs) are an easily accessible source of respiratory tissue for such a model. Herein, we describe the generation of a three-dimensional spheroid model of CFTR function and modulation using primary HNEs. HNEs are isolated from subjects in a minimally invasive fashion, expanded in conditional reprogramming conditions, and seeded into the spheroid culture. Within 2 weeks of seeding, spheroid cultures generate HNE spheroids that can be stimulated with 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating agonists to activate CFTR function. Spheroid swelling is then quantified as a proxy of CFTR activity. HNE spheroids capitalize on the minimally invasive, yet respiratory origin of nasal cells to generate an accessible, personalized model relevant to an epithelium reflecting disease morbidity and mortality. Compared to the air-liquid interface HNE cultures, spheroids are relatively quick to mature, which reduces the overall contamination rate. In its current form, the model is limited by low throughput, though this is offset by the relative ease of tissue acquisition. HNE spheroids can be used to reliably quantify and characterize CFTR activity at the individual level. An ongoing study to tie this quantification to in vivo drug response will determine if HNE spheroids are a true preclinical predictor of patient response to CFTR modulation.},

abstract = {Drug discovery by high-throughput screening is a promising approach to develop new therapies for the most common lethal genetic disease, cystic fibrosis. Because disease-causing mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein produce epithelial cells with reduced or absent Cl− permeability, the goal of screening is to identify compounds that restore cell Cl− transport. We have developed a rapid, quantitative screening procedure for analysis of CFTR-mediated halide transport in cells with the use of a conventional fluorescence plate reader. Doubly transfected cell lines were generated that express wild-type or mutant CFTR together with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-based halide sensor. CFTR function was assayed from the time course of cell fluorescence in response to extracellular addition of 100 mM I− followed by forskolin, resulting in decreased YFP fluorescence due to CFTR-mediated I− entry. Cell lines were chosen, and conditions were optimized to minimize basal halide transport to maximize assay sensitivity. In cells cultured on 96-well plastic dishes, the assay gave reproducible halide permeabilities from well to well and could reliably detect a 2{\%} activation of CFTR-dependent halide transport produced by low concentrations of forskolin. Applications of the assay are shown, including comparative dose-dependent CFTR activation by genistein, apigenin, 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, IBMX, 8-methoxypsoralen, and milrinone as well as activation of alternative Cl− channels. The fluorescence assay and cell lines should facilitate the screening of novel CFTR activators and the characterization of alternative Cl− channels and transporters.},

Here we apply this technology to study primary intestinal organoids of people suffering from cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by mutations in CFTR, encoding cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. Forskolin induces rapid swelling of organoids derived from healthy controls or wild-type mice, but this effect is strongly reduced in organoids of subjects with cystic fibrosis or in mice carrying the Cftr F508del mutation and is absent in Cftr-deficient organoids. This pattern is phenocopied by CFTR-specific inhibitors. Forskolin-induced swelling of in vitro-expanded human control and cystic fibrosis organoids corresponds quantitatively with forskolin-induced anion currents in freshly excised ex vivo rectal biopsies. Function of the CFTR F508del mutant protein is restored by incubation at low temperature, as well as by CFTR-restoring compounds. This relatively simple and robust assay will facilitate diagnosis, functional studies, drug development and personalized medicine approaches in cystic fibrosis.},

High concentrations of aminoglycosides can restore gene function by eliciting premature termi-nation codon readthrough but with low efficiency. Using a high-throughput screen, we identified com-pounds that potentiate readthrough by aminoglyco-sides at multiple nonsense alleles in yeast. Chemical optimization generated phthalimide derivative CDX5-1 with activity in human cells. Alone, CDX5-1 did not induce readthrough or increase TP53 mRNA levels in HDQ-P1 cancer cells with a homozygous TP53 nonsense mutation. However, in combination with aminoglycoside G418, it enhanced readthrough up to 180-fold over G418 alone. The combination also increased readthrough at all three nonsense codons in cancer cells with other TP53 nonsense mutations, as well as in cells from rare genetic disease patients with nonsense mutations in the CLN2, SMARCAL1 and DMD genes. These findings open up the possibil-ity of treating patients across a spectrum of genetic diseases caused by nonsense mutations.},

We have previously reported the identification and characterization of an LKB1-specific adaptor protein, STRAD, which activates LKB1 and translocates it from nucleus to cytoplasm. We have now constructed intestinal epithelial cell lines in which inducible STRAD activates LKB1. Upon LKB1 activation, single cells rapidly remodel their actin cytoskeleton to form an apical brush border. The junctional proteins ZO-1 and p120 redistribute in a dotted circle peripheral to the brush border, in the absence of cell-cell contacts. Apical and basolateral markers sort to their respective membrane domains. We conclude that LKB1 can induce complete polarity in intestinal epithelial cells. In contrast to current thinking on polarization of simple epithelia, these cells can fully polarize in the absence of junctional cell-cell contacts.},

abstract = {The most common cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutation, delta F508-CFTR, is a partially functional chloride channel that is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. We hypothesize that a known transcriptional regulator, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA), will enable a greater fraction of delta F508-CFTR to escape degradation and appear at the cell surface. Primary cultures of nasal polyp epithelia from CF patients (delta F508 homozygous or heterozygous), or the CF bronchial epithelial cell line IB3-1 (delta F508/W1282X) were exposed to 4PBA for up to 7 d in culture. 4PBA treatment at concentrations of 0.1 and 2 mM resulted in the restoration of forskolin-activated chloride secretion. Protein kinase A-activated, linear, 10 pS chloride channels appeared at the plasma membrane of IB3-1 cells at the tested concentration of 2.5 mM. Treatment of IB3-1 cells with 0.1-1 mM 4PBA and primary nasal epithelia with 5 mM 4PBA also resulted in the appearance of higher molecular mass forms of CFTR consistent with addition and modification of oligosaccharides in the Golgi apparatus, as detected by immunoblotting of whole cell lysates with anti-CFTR antisera. Immunocytochemistry in CF epithelial cells treated with 4PBA was consistent with increasing amounts of delta F508-CFTR. These data indicate that 4PBA is a promising pharmacologic agent for inducing correction of the CF phenotype in CF patients carrying the delta F508 mutation.},

abstract = {In the 50 years since their discovery, the aminoglycoside antibiotics have seen unprecedented use. Discovered in the 1940s, they were the long-sought remedy for tuberculosis and other serious bacterial infections. The side effects of renal and auditory toxicity, however, led to a decline of their use in most countries in the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, today the aminoglycosides are still the most commonly used antibiotics worldwide thanks to the combination of their high efficacy with low cost. This review first summarizes the history, chemistry, antibacterial actions and acute side effects of the drugs. It then details the pathophysiology of aminoglycoside ototoxicity including experimental and clinical observations, risk factors and incidence. Pharmacokinetics, cellular actions and our current understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms of ototoxicity are discussed at length. The review concludes with recent advances towards therapeutic intervention to prevent aminoglycoside ototoxicity.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis is a common autosomal recessive disorder that primarily affects the epithelial cells in the intestine, respiratory system, pancreas, gall bladder and sweat glands. Over one thousand mutations have currently been identified in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene that are associated with CF disease. There have been many studies on the correlation of the CFTR genotype and CF disease phenotype; however, this relationship is still not well understood. A connection between CFTR genotype and disease manifested in the pancreas has been well described, but pulmonary disease appears to be highly variable even between individuals with the same genotype. This review describes the current classification of CFTR mutation classes and resulting CF disease phenotypes. Complex disease alleles and modifier genes are discussed along with alternative disorders, such as disseminated bronchiectasis and pancreatitis, which are also thought to result from CFTR mutations.},

They induce truncated, usually non-functional, proteins, degradation of the PTC containing transcripts by the nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway and abnormal exon skipping. Readthrough compounds facilitate near cognate amino-acyl-tRNA incorporation, leading potentially to restoration of a functional full-length protein.Splicing mutations can lead to aberrantly spliced transcripts by creating a cryptic splice site or destroying a normal site. Most mutations result in disruption of the open reading frame and activation of NMD. Antisense oligonucleotides are single stranded short synthetic RNA-like molecules chemically modified to improve their stability and ability to recognize their target RNAs and modify the splice site. This review focuses on recent developments in therapies aiming to improve the health of CF patients carrying nonsense or splicing mutations.},

Corr-4a increased ??F508 CFTR-dependent Cl- conductance in both cell types, whereas treatment with VRT-325 or VRT-640 increased activity only in FRT cells. Total currents stimulated by forskolin and genistein demonstrated similar dose/response effects to Corr-4a treatment in each cell type. When examining the relative contribution of forskolin and genistein to total stimulated current, CFBE41o- cells had smaller forskolin-stimulated Isc following either low temperature or corr-4a treatment (10-30{\%} of the total Isc produced by the combination of both CFTR agonists). In contrast, forskolin consistently contributed greater than 40{\%} of total Isc in ??F508 CFTR-expressing FRT cells corrected with low temperature, and corr-4a treatment preferentially enhanced forskolin dependent currents only in FRT cells (60{\%} of total Isc). ??F508 CFTR cDNA transcript levels, ??F508 CFTR C band levels, or cAMP signaling did not account for the reduced forskolin response in CFBE41o- cells. Treatment with non-specific inhibitors of phosphodiesterases (papaverine) or phosphatases (endothall) did not restore ??F508 CFTR activation by forskolin in CFBE41o- cells, indicating that the Cl- transport defect in airway cells is distal to cAMP or its metabolism. The results identify important differences in ??F508 CFTR activation in polarizing epithelial models of CF, and have important implications regarding detection of rescued of ??F508 CFTR in vivo. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) contains two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) or ATP-binding cassettes (ABCs) that characterize a large family of membrane transporters. Although the three-dimensional structures of these domains from several ABC proteins have been determined, this is not the case for CFTR, and hence the domains are defined simply on the basis of sequence alignment. The functional C-terminal boundary of NBD1 of CFTR was located by analysis of chloride channel function [Chan, Csanady, Seto-Young, Nairn and Gadsby (2000) J. Gen. Physiol. 116, 163-180]. However, the boundary between the C-terminal end of NBD2 and sequences further downstream in the whole protein, that are important for its cellular localization and endocytotic turnover, has not been defined. We have now done this by assaying the influence of progressive C-terminal truncations on photolabelling of NBD2 by 8-azido-ATP, which reflects hydrolysis, as well as binding, at that domain, and on NBD2-dependent channel gating itself. The boundary defined in this way is between residues 1420 and 1424, which corresponds to the final beta-strand in aligned NBDs whose structures have been determined. Utilization of this information should facilitate the generation of monodisperse NBD2 polypeptides for structural analysis, which until now has not been possible. The established boundary includes within NBD2 a hydrophobic patch of four residues (1413-1416) previously shown to be essential for CFTR maturation and stability [Gentzsch and Riordan (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 1291-1298]. This hydrophobic cluster is conserved in most ABC proteins, and on alignment with ones of known structure constitutes the penultimate beta-strand of the domain which is likely to participate in essential structure-stabilizing beta-sheet formation.},

abstract = {W1282X is the fifth most common CFTR mutation that causes cystic fibrosis. Here, we investigated the utility of a small molecule corrector / potentiator strategy, as used for $\Delta$F508-CFTR, to produce functional rescue of the truncated translation product of the W1282X mutation, CFTR1281, without the need for read-through. In transfected cell systems, certain potentiators and correctors including VX-809 and VX-770 increased CFTR1281 activity. To identify novel correctors and potentiators with potentially greater efficacy on CFTR1281, functional screens were done of {\~{}}30,000 synthetic small molecules and drugs/nutraceuticals in CFTR1281-transfected cells. Corrector scaffolds of 1-arylpyrazole-4-arylsulfonyl-piperazine and spiro-piperidine-quinazolinone classes were identified with up to {\~{}}5-fold greater efficacy than VX-809, some of which were selective for CFTR1281 while others also corrected $\Delta$F508-CFTR. Several novel potentiator scaffolds were identified with efficacy comparable to VX-770; remarkably, a phenylsulfonamide-pyrrolopyridine acted synergistically with VX-770 to increase CFTR1281 function {\~{}}8-fold over that of VX-770 alone, normalizing CFTR1281 channel activity to that of wild type CFTR. Corrector and potentiator combinations were tested in primary cultures and conditionally reprogrammed cells generated from nasal brushings from one W1282X homozygous subject. Though robust chloride conductance was seen with correctors and potentiators in homozygous $\Delta$F508 cells, increased chloride conductance was not found in W1282X cells despite the presence of adequate transcript. Notwithstanding the negative data in W1282X cells from one human subject, we speculate that corrector and potentiator combinations may have therapeutic efficacy in CF caused by the W1282X mutation, though additional studies are needed on human cells from W1282X subjects.},

abstract = {Aminoglycosides can readthrough premature termination codons (PTCs), permitting translation of full-length proteins. Previously we have found variable efficiency of readthrough in response to the aminoglycoside gentamicin among cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, all carrying the W1282X nonsense mutation. Here we demonstrate that there are patients in whom the level of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) nonsense transcripts is markedly reduced, while in others it is significantly higher. Response to gentamicin was found only in patients with the higher level. We further investigated the possibility that the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) might vary among cells and hence governs the level of nonsense transcripts available for readthrough. Our results demonstrate differences in NMD efficiency of CFTR transcripts carrying the W1282X mutation among different epithelial cell lines derived from the same tissue. Variability was also found for 5 physiologic NMD substrates, RPL3, SC35 1.6 kb, SC35 1.7 kb, ASNS, and CARS. Importantly, our results demonstrate the existence of cells in which NMD of all transcripts was efficient and others in which the NMD was less efficient. Downregulation of NMD in cells carrying the W1282X mutation increased the level of CFTR nonsense transcripts and enhanced the CFTR chloride channel activity in response to gentamicin. Together our results suggest that the efficiency of NMD might vary and hence have an important role in governing the response to treatments aiming to promote readthrough of PTCs in many genetic diseases.},

abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this review is to summarize the recent approaches using mutation-specific therapy to correct the genetic defect according to the molecular mechanism by which the mutation causes the defects in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Premature stop mutations (class I mutations) account for 5 to 10{\%} of the total mutant alleles in cystic fibrosis patients, and in certain subpopulations the incidence is much higher. RECENT FINDINGS: The aminoglycoside antibiotics can suppress premature termination codons by permitting translation to continue to the normal termination of the transcript. The susceptibility to suppression by aminoglycosides depends on the stop codon itself and on the sequence context surrounding it. In vitro studies in cell lines expressing stop mutations and in mice have shown that aminoglycosides caused a dose-dependent increase in CFTR expression and restored functional CFTR to the apical membrane. Clinical studies also provided evidence that the aminoglycoside gentamicin can suppress these CFTR premature stop mutations in affected patients. A recent double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study has demonstrated restoration of CFTR function by topical application of gentamicin to the nasal epithelium of cystic fibrosis patients carrying stop mutations. In 21{\%} of the patients there was a complete normalization of all the electrophysiologic abnormalities caused by the CFTR defect, and in 68{\%} there was restoration of either chloride or sodium transport. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining to the C-terminal part of the CFTR was demonstrated via peripheral staining for CFTR in scraped nasal epithelial cells of patients carrying stop mutations. Inconsistent results were reported regarding the required level of corrected CFTR that has to be reached to achieve normal function. Achieving CFTR activity of 10 to 35{\%} might be needed to prevent significant pulmonary morbidity. SUMMARY: It is as yet unknown how much corrected mutant CFTR must reach the apical membrane to induce a clinically relevant beneficial effect. The future goal is to maximize the effect of stop-codon supressors on CFTR while minimizing side effects, but further studies must be performed to find a safer compound that may be administered in small children from the time of diagnosis.},

abstract = {Vx-770 (Ivacaftor), a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for clinical application to patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), shifts the paradigm from conventional symptomatic treatments to therapeutics directly tackling the root of the disease: functional defects of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regula-tor (CFTR) chloride channel caused by pathogenic mutations. The underlying mechanism for the action of Vx-770 remains elusive partly because this compound not only increases the activity of wild-type (WT) channels whose gating is primarily controlled by ATP binding/hydrolysis, but also improves the function of G551D-CFTR, a disease-associated mutation that abolishes CFTR's respon-siveness to ATP. Here we provide a unified theory to account for this dual effect of Vx-770. We found that Vx-770 enhances spon-taneous, ATP-independent activity of WT-CFTR to a similar magni-tude as its effects on G551D channels, a result essentially explaining Vx-770's effect on G551D-CFTR. Furthermore, Vx-770 increases the open time of WT-CFTR in an [ATP]-dependent man-ner. This distinct kinetic effect is accountable with a newly pro-posed CFTR gating model depicting an [ATP]-dependent " reentry " mechanism that allows CFTR shuffling among different open states by undergoing multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis. We fur-ther examined the effect of Vx-770 on R352C-CFTR, a unique mu-tant that allows direct observation of hydrolysis-triggered gating events. Our data corroborate that Vx-770 increases the open time of WT-CFTR by stabilizing a posthydrolytic open state and thereby fosters decoupling between the gating cycle and ATP hydrolysis cycle. The current study also suggests that this unique mechanism of drug action can be further exploited to develop strategies that enhance the function of CFTR.

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF), an inherited genetic disease, is caused by mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene, which encodes an ion channel involved in hydration maintenance by anion homeostasis. Ninety percent of CF patients possess one or more copies of the F508del CFTR mutation. This mutation disrupts trafficking of the protein to the plasma membrane and diminishes function of mature CFTR. Identifying small molecule modulators of mutant CFTR activity or biosynthesis may yield new tools for discovering novel CF treatments. One strategy utilizes a 384-well, cell-based fluorescence-quenching assay, which requires extensive wash steps, but reports sensitive changes in fluorescence-quenching kinetic rates. In this study, we describe the methods of adapting the protocol to a homogeneous, miniaturized 1,536-well format and further optimization of this functional F508del CFTR assay. The assay utilizes a cystic fibrosis bronchial epithelial (CFBE41o-) cell line, which was engineered to report CFTR-mediated intracellular flux of iodide by a halide-sensitive yellow fluorescence protein (YFP) reporter. We also describe the limitations of quench rate analysis and the subsequent incorporation of a novel, kinetic data analysis modality to quickly and efficiently find active CFTR modulators. This format yields a Z' value interval of 0.61 ± 0.05. As further evidence of high-throughput screen suitability, we subsequently completed a screening campaign of {\textgreater}645,000 compounds, identifying 2,811 initial hits. After completing secondary and tertiary follow-up assays, we identified 187 potential CFTR modulators, which EC50's {\textless} 5 $\mu$M. Thus, the assay has integrated the advantages of a phenotypic screen with high-throughput scalability to discover new small-molecule CFTR modulators.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 Massachusetts Medical Society. BACKGROUND: Combination treatment with the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulators tezacaftor (VX-661) and ivacaftor (VX-770) was designed to target the underlying cause of disease in patients with cystic fibrosis. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial, we evaluated combination therapy with tezacaftor and ivacaftor in patients 12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were homozygous for the CFTR Phe508del mutation. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 100 mg of tezacaftor once daily and 150 mg of ivacaftor twice daily or matched placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change in the percentage of the predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1 ) through week 24 (calculated in percentage points); relative change in the percentage of the predicted FEV 1 through week 24 (calculated as a percentage) was a key secondary end point. RESULTS: Of the 510 patients who underwent randomization, 509 received tezacaftor–ivacaftor or placebo, and 475 completed 24 weeks of the trial regimen. The mean FEV 1 at baseline was 60.0{\%} of the predicted value. The effects on the absolute and relative changes in the percentage of the predicted FEV 1 in favor of tezacaftor–ivacaftor over placebo were 4.0 percentage points and 6.8{\%}, respectively (P {\textless} 0.001 for both comparisons). The rate of pulmonary exacerbation was 35{\%} lower in the tezacaftor–ivacaftor group than in the placebo group (P=0.005). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups. Most adverse events were of mild severity (in 41.8{\%} of patients overall) or moderate severity (in 40.9{\%} overall), and serious adverse events were less frequent with tezacaftor–ivacaftor (12.4{\%}) than with placebo (18.2{\%}). A total of 2.9{\%} of patients discontinued the assigned regimen owing to adverse events. Fewer patients in the tezacaftor–ivacaftor group than in the placebo group had respiratory adverse events, none of which led to discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor was efficacious and safe in patients 12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were homozygous for the CFTR Phe508del mutation.},

abstract = {Abstract Premature stop codons are the result of nonsense mutations occurring within the coding sequence of a gene. These mutations lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein and are responsible for several genetic diseases. A potential pharmacological approach to treat these diseases is to promote the translational readthrough of premature stop codons by small molecules aiming to restore the full-length protein. The compound PTC124 (Ataluren) was reported to promote the readthrough of the premature UGA stop codon, although its activity was questioned. The potential interaction of PTC124 with mutated mRNA was recently suggested by molecular dynamics (MD) studies highlighting the importance of H-bonding and stacking $\pi$–$\pi$ interactions. To improve the readthrough activity we changed the fluorine number and position in the PTC124 fluoroaryl moiety. The readthrough ability of these PTC124 derivatives was tested in human cells harboring reporter plasmids with premature stop codons in H2BGFP and FLuc genes as well as in cystic fibrosis (CF) IB3.1 cells with a nonsense mutation. Maintaining low toxicity, three of these molecules showed higher efficacy than PTC124 in the readthrough of the UGA premature stop codon and in recovering the expression of the CFTR protein in IB3.1 cells from cystic fibrosis patient. Molecular dynamics simulations performed with mutated CFTR mRNA fragments and active or inactive derivatives are in agreement with the suggested interaction of PTC124 with mRNA.},

@article{Cutting2010,
abstract = {In the past three decades, scientists have had immense success in identifying genes and their variants that contribute to an array of diseases. While the identification of such genetic variants has informed our knowledge of the etiologic bases of diseases, there continues to be a substantial gap in our understanding of the factors that modify disease severity. Monogenic diseases provide an opportunity to identify modifiers as they have uniform etiology, detailed phenotyping of affected individuals, and familial clustering. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is among the more common life-shortening recessive disorders that displays wide variability in clinical features and survival. Considerable progress has been made in elucidating the contribution of genetic and nongenetic factors to CF. Allelic variation in CFTR, the gene responsible for CF, correlates with some aspects of the disease. However, lung function, neonatal intestinal obstruction, diabetes, and anthropometry display strong genetic control independent of CFTR, and candidate gene studies have revealed genetic modifiers underlying these traits. The application of genome-wide techniques holds great promise for the identification of novel genetic variants responsible for the heritable features and complications of CF. Since the genetic modifiers are known to alter the course of disease, their protein products become immediate targets for therapeutic intervention.},

abstract = {In-frame premature termination codons (PTCs) account for approximately 11{\%} of all disease-associated mutations. PTC suppression therapy utilizes small molecules that suppress translation termination at a PTC to restore synthesis of a full-length protein. PTC suppression is mediated by the base pairing of a near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA with a PTC and subsequently, the amino acid becomes incorporated into the nascent polypeptide at the site of the PTC. However, little is known about the identity of the amino acid(s) inserted at a PTC during this process in mammalian cells, or how the surrounding sequence context influences amino acid incorporation. Here we determined the amino acids inserted at the CFTR W1282X PTC (a UGA codon) in the context of its three upstream and downstream CFTR codons during G418-mediated suppression. We found that leucine, cysteine, and tryptophan are inserted during W1282X suppression. Interestingly, these amino acids (and their proportions) are significantly different from those recently identified following G418-mediated suppression of the CFTR G542X UGA mutation. These results demonstrate for the first time that local mRNA sequence context plays a key role in near-cognate aminoacyl-tRNA selection during PTC suppression. We also found that some variant CFTR proteins generated by PTC suppression exhibit reduced maturation and activity, indicating the complexity of nonsense suppression therapy. However, both a CFTR corrector and potentiator enhanced activity of protein variants generated by G418-mediated suppression. These results suggest that PTC suppression in combination with CFTR modulators may be beneficial for the treatment of CF patients with PTCs.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a monogenic autosomal recessive disorder affecting around 75,000 individuals worldwide. It is a multi-system disease but the main morbidity and mortality is caused by chronic lung disease. Due to newborn screening, a multidisciplinary approach to care and intensive symptomatic treatment, the prognosis has dramatically improved over the last decades and there are currently more adults than children in many countries. However, CF is still a very severe disease with a current median age of life expectancy in the fourth decade of life. The disease is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene which encodes the CFTR protein, a protein kinase A-activated ATP-gated anion channel that regulates the transport of electrolytes such as chloride and bicarbonate. More than 2000 mutations have been reported, although not all of these have functional consequences. An enormous research effort and progress has been made in understanding the consequences of these mutations on the CFTR protein structure and function, and this has led to the approval of two new drug therapies that are able to bind to defective CFTR proteins and partially restore their function. They are mutation-specific therapies and available at present for specific mutations only. They are the first personalized medicine for CF with a possible disease-modifying effect. A pipeline of other compounds is under development with different mechanisms of action. It is foreseeable that new combinations of compounds will further improve the correction of CFTR function. Other strategies including premature stop codon read-through drugs, antisense oligonucleotides that correct the basic defect at the mRNA level or gene editing to restore the defective gene as well as gene therapy approaches are all in the pipeline. All these strategies are needed to develop disease-modifying therapies for all patients with CF.},

@article{Wilschanski2003,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene containing a premature termination signal cause a deficiency or absence of functional chloride-channel activity. Aminoglycoside antibiotics can suppress premature termination codons, thus permitting translation to continue to the normal end of the transcript. We assessed whether topical administration of gentamicin to the nasal epithelium of patients with cystic fibrosis could result in the expression of functional CFTR channels. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, patients with stop mutations in CFTR or patients homozygous for the DeltaF508 mutation received two drops containing gentamicin (0.3 percent, or 3 mg per milliliter) or placebo in each nostril three times daily for two consecutive periods of 14 days. Nasal potential difference was measured at base line and after each treatment period. Nasal epithelial cells were obtained before and after gentamicin treatment from patients carrying stop mutations, and the C-terminal of surface CFTR was stained. RESULTS: Gentamicin treatment caused a significant reduction in basal potential difference in the 19 patients carrying stop mutations (from -45+/-8 to -34+/-11 mV, P=0.005) and a significant response to chloride-free isoproterenol solution (from 0+/-3.6 to -5+/-2.7 mV, P{\textless}0.001). This effect of gentamicin on nasal potential difference occurred both in patients who were homozygous for stop mutations and in those who were heterozygous, but not in patients who were homozygous for DeltaF508. After gentamicin treatment, a significant increase in peripheral and surface staining for CFTR was observed in the nasal epithelial cells of patients carrying stop mutations. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cystic fibrosis who have premature stop codons, gentamicin can cause translational "read through," resulting in the expression of full-length CFTR protein at the apical cell membrane, and thus can correct the typical electrophysiological abnormalities caused by CFTR dysfunction.},

abstract = {Mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene cause cystic fibrosis. CFTR-dependent iodide transport measured by fluorescent quenching of ectopically expressed halide-sensitive yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) is widely being used to study CFTR function by microscopy or plate readers. Since YFP fluorescence in these systems is dependent on YFP expression levels and iodide concentration, differences in sensor expression level between experimental units are normalized at the start of each experiment. To allow accurate measurement of CFTR function by flow cytometry, we reasoned that co-expression of an iodide insensitive fluorescent protein would allow for normalization of sensor expression levels and more accurate quantification of CFTR function. Our data indicated that dsRed and mKate fluorescence are iodide insensitive, and we determined an optimal format for co-expression of these fluorescent proteins with halide-sensitive YFP. We showed using microscopy that ratiometric measurement (YFP/mKate) corrects for differences in sensor expression levels. Ratiometric measurements were essential to accurately measure CFTR function by flow cytometry that we here describe for the first time. Mixing of wild type or mutant CFTR expressing cells indicated that addition of approximately 10{\%} of wild type CFTR expressing cells could be distinguished by ratiometric YFP quenching. Flow cytometric ratiometric YFP quenching also allowed us to study CFTR mutants associated with differential residual function upon ectopic expression. Compared with conventional plate-bound CFTR function assays, the flow cytometric approach described here can be used to study CFTR function in suspension cells. It may be further adapted to study CFTR function in heterologous cell populations using cell surface markers and selection of cells that display high CFTR function by cell sorting. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

abstract = {Genetically modified mice have been studied for more than fifteen years as models of cystic fibrosis (CF). The large amount of experimental data generated illuminates the complex multi-organ pathology of CF and raises new questions relevant to human disease. CF mice have also been used to test experimental therapies prior to clinical trials. This review recapitulates the major phenotypic traits of CF mice and highlights important new findings including aberrant alveolar macrophages, bone and cartilage abnormalities and abnormal bioactive lipid metabolism. Novel data are presented on the intestinal and nasal physiology of F508del-CFTR CF mice backcrossed onto different genetic backgrounds. Caveats, and sources of variability including age, gender and animal husbandry, are discussed. Interspecies differences limit comparison of lung pathology in CF mice to the human disease. The recent development of genetically modified pigs and ferrets heralds the application of more advanced animal models to CF research and drug development. ?? 2011 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

Here, functional small interfering RNA screens revealed the contribution of chaperones, cochaperones, and ubiquitin-conjugating and -ligating enzymes to the elimination of unfolded CFTR from the cell surface, as part of a peripheral protein quality-control system. Ubiquitination of nonnative CFTR was required for efficient internalization and lysosomal degradation.

abstract = {To investigate the degradation mechanism of misfolded membrane proteins from the cell surface, we used mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulators (CFTRs) exhibiting conformational defects in post-Golgi compartments. Here, we show that the folding state of CFTR determines the post-endocytic trafficking of the channel. Although native CFTR recycled from early endosomes back to the cell surface, misfolding prevented recycling and facilitated lysosomal targeting by promoting the ubiquitination of the channel. Rescuing the folding defect or down-regulating the E1 ubiquitin (Ub)-activating enzyme stabilized the mutant CFTR without interfering with its internalization. These observations with the preferential association of mutant CFTRs with Hrs, STAM-2, TSG101, hVps25, and hVps32, components of the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery, establish a functional link between Ub modification and lysosomal degradation of misfolded CFTR from the cell surface. Our data provide evidence for a novel cellular mechanism of CF pathogenesis and suggest a paradigm for the quality control of plasma membrane proteins involving the coordinated function of ubiquitination and the Ub-dependent endosomal sorting machinery.},

abstract = {Polarized and pseudostratified primary airway epithelia present barriers that significantly reduce their transfection efficiency and the efficacy of RNA interference oligonucleotides. This creates an impediment in studies of the airway epithelium, diminishing the utility of loss-of-function as a research tool. Here we outline methods to introduce RNAi oligonucleotides into primary human and porcine airway epithelia grown at an air-liquid interface and difficult-to-transfect transformed epithelial cell lines grown on plastic. At the time of plating, we reverse transfect small-interfering RNA (siRNA), Dicer-substrate siRNA, or microRNA oligonucleotides into cells by use of lipid or peptide transfection reagents. Using this approach we achieve significant knockdown in vitro of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, IL-8, and CFTR expression at the mRNA and protein levels in 1-3 days. We also attain significant reduction of secreted IL-8 in polarized primary pig airway epithelia 3 days posttransfection and inhibition of CFTR-mediated Cl(-) conductance in polarized air-liquid interface cultures of human airway epithelia 2 wk posttransfection. These results highlight an efficient means to deliver RNA interference reagents to airway epithelial cells and achieve significant knockdown of target gene expression and function. The ability to reliably conduct loss-of-function assays in polarized primary airway epithelia offers benefits to research in studies of epithelial cell homeostasis, candidate gene function, gene-based therapeutics, microRNA biology, and targeting the replication of respiratory viruses.},

METHODS: A proprietary database containing 335,204 consecutive CF DNA tests and 445 CF prenatal diagnostic tests was queried. Clinical information was obtained for prenatal and selected nonprenatal cases by telephone contact with physician offices. RESULTS: The mutation 1078delT was found in much lower frequency than expected with rates of only 1:55,867 tests and 0.06{\%} of CF mutations. This level is below the threshold set by the American College of Medical Genetics. Homozygosity was observed for 2789+5G{\textgreater}A in a 29-year-old women and compound heterozygosity with delta F408 in a 40-year-old woman with isolated chronic sinusitis. Many patients elected prenatal diagnosis when not at a 1:4 risk due to echogenic bowel or IVS-8 5T issues. CONCLUSIONS: With the exception of 1078delT, all CF mutations in the ACMG panel were detected with a frequency of {\textgreater} 0.1{\%} of CF chromosomes.

abstract = {Combination drug therapies under development for cystic fibrosis caused by the$\Delta$ F508 mutation in cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR) include a“corrector ” to improve its cellular processing and a“potentiator” to improve its chloride channel function. Recently, it was reported that the approved potentiatorN-(2,4-di-tert -butyl-5-hydroxyphenyl)-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline-3-carboxamide (Ivacaftor) reduces $\Delta$ F508-CFTR cellular stability and the efficacy of investigational correctors, including 3-(6-[([1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)cyclopropyl]carbonyl) amino]-3-methyl-2-pyridinyl)-benzoic acid and 1-(2,2-difluoro-1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-N-(1-[(2R )-2,3-dihydroxypropyl]-6-fluoro-2-(2-hydroxy-1,1-dimethylethyl)-1H -indol-5-yl), which might contribute to the modest reported efficacy of combination therapy in clinical trials. Here, we report the identification and characterization of potentiators that do not interfere with$\Delta$ F508-CFTR stability or corrector action. High-throughput screening and structure-activity analysis identified several classes of potentiators that do not impair corrector action, including tetrahydrobenzothiophenes, thiooxoaminothiazoles, and pyrazole-pyrrole-isoxazoles. The most potent compounds have an EC50for$\Delta$ F508-CFTR potentiation down to 18 nM and do not reduce corrector efficacy in heterologous$\Delta$F508-CFTR – expressing cells or primary cultures of$\Delta$F508/$\Delta$ F508 human bronchial epithelia. TheD F508-CFTR potentiators also activated wild-type and G551D CFTR, alb eit weakly. The efficacy of combination therapy for cystic fibrosis caused by the$\Delta$ F508 mutation may be improved by replacement of Ivacaftor with a potentiator that does not interfere with corrector action.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a plasma membrane-associated glycoprotein. The protein can exist in three different molecular weight forms of approximately 127, 131, and 160 kDa, representing either nonglycosylated, core glycosylated, or fully mature, complex glycosylated CFTR, respectively. The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis (CF) results in the synthesis of a variant (DELTAF508-CFTR) that is incompletely glycosylated and defective in its trafficking to the cell surface. In this study, we have analyzed the oligosaccharide structures associated with the different forms of recombinant CFTR, by expressing and purifying the channel protein from either mammalian Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) or insect Sf9 cells. Using glycosidases and FACE analysis (fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis) we determined that purified CHO-CFTR contained polylactosaminoglycan (PL) sequences, while Sf9-CFTR had only oligomannosidic saccharides with fucosylation on the innermost GlcNAc. The presence of PL sequences on the recombinant CHO-CFTR is consistent with a normal feature of mammalian processing, since endogenous CFTR isolated from T84 cells displayed a similar pattern of glycosylation. The present study also reports on the use of FACE for the qualitative analysis of small amounts of glycoprotein oligosaccharides released enzymatically.},

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a fatal genetic disorder associated with defective hydration of lung airways due to the loss of chloride transport through the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein (CFTR). CFTR contains two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain, and its channel assembly requires multiple interdomain contacts. The most common CF-causing mutation, F508del, occurs in NBD1 and results in misfolding and premature degradation of F508del-CFTR. VX-809 is an investigational CFTR corrector that partially restores CFTR function in people who are homozygous for F508del-CFTR. To identify the folding defect(s) in F508del-CFTR that must be repaired to treat CF, we explored the mechanism of VX-809 action. VX-809 stabilized an N-terminal domain in CFTR that contains only MSD1 and efficaciously restored function to CFTR forms that have missense mutations in MSD1. The action of VX-809 on MSD1 appears to suppress folding defects in F508del-CFTR by enhancing interactions among the NBD1, MSD1, and MSD2 domains. The ability of VX-809 to correct F508del-CFTR is enhanced when combined with mutations that improve F508del-NBD1 interaction with MSD2. These data suggest that the use of VX-809 in combination with an additional CFTR corrector that suppresses folding defects downstream of MSD1 may further enhance CFTR function in people with F508del-CFTR.},

The aim of this in vitro study was to determine whether ivacaftor potentiates mutant CFTR with gating defects caused by other CFTR gating mutations. Methods: The effects of ivacaftor on CFTR channel open probability and chloride transport were tested in electrophysiological studies using Fischer rat thyroid (FRT) cells expressing different CFTR gating mutations. Results: Ivacaftor potentiated multiple mutant CFTR forms with defects in CFTR channel gating. These included the G551D, G178R, S549N, S549R, G551S, G970R, G1244E, S1251N, S1255P and G1349D CFTR gating mutations. Conclusion: These in vitro data suggest that ivacaftor has a similar effect on all CFTR forms with gating defects and support investigation of the potential clinical benefit of ivacaftor in CF patients who have CFTR gating mutations beyond G551D. {\textcopyright} 2012 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.},

abstract = {We demonstrate that a Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632), in combination with fibroblast feeder cells, induces normal and tumor epithelial cells from many tissues to proliferate indefinitely in vitro, without transduction of exogenous viral or cellular genes. Primary prostate and mammary cells, for example, are reprogrammed toward a basaloid, stem-like phenotype and form well-organized prostaspheres and mammospheres in Matrigel. However, in contrast to the selection of rare stem-like cells, the described growth conditions can generate 2 ?? 10 6 cells in 5 to 6 days from needle biopsies, and can generate cultures from cryopreserved tissue and from fewer than four viable cells. Continued cell proliferation is dependent on both feeder cells and Y-27632, and the conditionally reprogrammed cells (CRCs) retain a normal karyotype and remain nontumorigenic. This technique also efficiently establishes cell cultures from human and rodent tumors. For example, CRCs established from human prostate adenocarcinoma displayed instability of chromosome 13, proliferated abnormally in Matrigel, and formed tumors in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency. The ability to rapidly generate many tumor cells from small biopsy specimens and frozen tissue provides significant opportunities for cell-based diagnostics and therapeutics (including chemosensitivity testing) and greatly expands the value of biobanking.

abstract = {Localized mRNA provides spatial and temporal protein expression essential to cell development and physiology. To explore the mechanisms involved, considerable effort has been spent in establishing new and improved methods for visualizing mRNA. Here, we discuss how these techniques have extended our understanding of intracellular mRNA localization in a variety of organisms. In addition to increased ease and specificity of detection in fixed tissue, in situ hybridization methods now enable examination of mRNA distribution at the ultrastructural level with electron microscopy. Most significantly, methods for following the movement of mRNA in living cells are now in widespread use. These include the introduction of labeled transcripts by microinjection, hybridization based methods using labeled antisense probes and complementary transgenic methods for tagging endogenous mRNAs using bacteriophage components. These technical innovations are now being coupled with super-resolution light microscopy methods and promise to revolutionize our understanding of the dynamics and complexity of the molecular mechanism of mRNA localization. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although, the most common Cystic Fibrosis mutation, $\Delta$F508, in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. (CFTR), is located in nucleotide binding domain (NBD1), disease-causing mutations also occur in NBD2. To provide information on potential therapeutic strategies for mutations in NBD2, we studied, using a combination of biochemical approaches and newly created cell lines, two disease-causing NBD2 mutants, N1303K and S1235R. Surprisingly, neither was rescued by low temperature. Inhibition of proteasomes with MG132 or aggresomes with tubacin rescued the immature B and mature C bands of N1303K and S1235R, indicating that degradation occurs via proteasomes and aggresomes. We found no effect of the lysosome inhibitor E64. Thus, our results show that these NBD2 mutants are processing mutants with unique characteristics. Several known correctors developed to rescue $\Delta$F508-CFTR, when applied either alone or in combination, significantly increased the maturation of bands B and C of both NBD 2 mutants. The best correction occurred with the combinations of C4 plus C18 or C3 plus C4. Co-transfection of truncated CFTR (∆27-264) into stably transfected cells was also able to rescue them. This demonstrates for the first time that transcomplementation with a truncated version of CFTR can rescue NBD2 mutants. Our results show that the N1303K mutation has a more profound effect on NBD2 processing than S1235R and that small-molecule correctors increase the maturation of bands B and C in NBD2 mutants. In addition, ∆27-264 was able to transcomplement both NDB2 mutants. We conclude that differences and similarities occur in the impact of mutations on NBD2 when compared to $\Delta$F508-CFTR suggesting that individualized strategies may be needed to restore their function. Finally our results are important because they suggest that gene or corrector molecule therapies either alone or in combination individualized for NBD2 mutants may be beneficial for patients bearing N1303K or S1235R mutations.},

It has an elevated prevalence among patients with atypically mild disease and normal sweat electrolytes and is especially prominent in Ashkenazi Jews. This class of splicing mutations, reported in several genes, involves novel splice sites activated deep within introns while leaving wild-type splice elements intact. CFTR cDNA constructs that modeled the 3849 + 10 kb C --{\textgreater} T mutation were expressed in 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and in CFT1 human tracheal and C127 mouse mammary epithelial cells. In all three cell types, aberrant splicing of CFTR pre-mRNA was comparable to that reported in vivo in CF patients. Treatment of the cells with 2'-O-methyl phosphorothioate oligoribonucleotides antisense toward the aberrant donor and acceptor splice sites or to the retained exon-like sequence, disfavored aberrant splicing and enhanced normal processing of CFTR pre-mRNA. This antisense-mediated correction of splicing was dose- and sequence-dependent and was accompanied by increased production of CFTR protein that was appropriately glycosylated. Antisense-mediated correction of splicing in a mutation-specific context represents a potential gene therapy modality with applicability to many inherited disorders.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) plays a fundamental role in fluid and electrolyte transport across epithelial tissues. Based on its structure, function and regulation, CFTR is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. These transporters are assembled from two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). In the vast majority of ABC transporters, the NBDs form a common engine that utilises the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump a wide spectrum of substrates through diverse transmembrane pathways formed by the MSDs. By contrast, in CFTR the MSDs form a pathway for passive anion flow that is gated by cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis by the NBDs. Here, we consider how the interaction of ATP with two ATP-binding sites, formed by the NBDs, powers conformational changes in CFTR structure to gate the channel pore. We explore how conserved sequences from both NBDs form ATP-binding sites at the interface of an NBD dimer and highlight the distinct roles that each binding site plays during the gating cycle. Knowledge of how ATP gates the CFTR Cl- channel is critical for understanding CFTR's physiological role, its malfunction in disease and the mechanism of action of small molecules that modulate CFTR channel gating.},

A significant fraction of these ( approximately 13{\%}) affect pre-mRNA splicing for which novel therapies have been somewhat neglected. We have previously described the effect of the CFTR splicing mutation c.2657+5G{\textgreater}A in IVS16, showing that it originates transcripts lacking exon 16 as well as wild-type transcripts. Here, we tested an RNA-based antisense oligonucleotide (AON) strategy to correct the aberrant splicing caused by this mutation. Two AONs (AON1/2) complementary to the pre-mRNA IVS16 mutant region were designed and their effect on splicing was assessed at the RNA and protein levels, on intracellular protein localization and function. To this end, we used the 2657+5G{\textgreater}A mutant CFTR minigene stably expressed in HEK293 Flp-In cells that express a single copy of the transgene. RNA data from AON1-treated mutant cells show that exon 16 inclusion was almost completely restored (to 95{\%}), also resulting in increased levels of correctly localized CFTR protein at the plasma membrane (PM) and with increased function. A novel two-color CFTR splicing reporter minigene developed here allowed the quantitative monitoring of splicing by automated microscopy localization of CFTR at the PM. The AON strategy is thus a promising therapeutic approach for the specific correction of alternative splicing.},

Rev. 79, Suppl.: S145-S166, 1999. - Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene family. Although CFTR has the structure of a transporter that transports substrates across the membrane in a nonconductive manner, CFTR also has the intrinsic ability to conduct Cl- at much higher rates, a function unique to CFTR among this family of ABC transporters. Because Cl- transport was shown to be lost in cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelia long before the cloning of the CF gene and CFTR, CFTR Cl- channel function was considered to be paramount. Another equally valid perspective of CFTR, however, derives from its membership in a family of transporters that transports a multitude of different substances from chemotherapeutic drugs, to amino acids, to glutathione conjugates, to small peptides in a nonconductive manner. Moreover, at least two members of this ABC transporter family (mdr-1, SUR) can regulate other ion channels in the membrane. More simply, ABC transporters can regulate somehow the function of other cellular proteins or cellular functions. This review focuses on a plethora of studies showing that CFTR also regulates other ion channel proteins. It is the hope of the authors that the reader will take with him or her the message that CFTR is a conductance regulator as well as a Cl- channel.},

A455E could be rescued by treatment of the cells with proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, co-transfection of A455E with the truncation mutant $\Delta$264 CFTR also rescued the mature C band, indicating that A455E can be rescued by transcomplementation.

abstract = {One feature of the mutations thus far found to be associated with the disease cystic fibrosis (CF) is that many of them are clustered within the first nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). We sought to discover the molecular basis for this clustering by introducing into the two NBDs of CFTR mutations either mimicking amino acid changes associated with CF or altering residues within highly conserved motifs. Synthesis and maturation of the mutant CFTR were studied by transient expression in COS cells. The ability of the altered proteins to generate cyclic AMP-stimulated anion efflux was assessed by using 6-methoxy-N-(sulfopropyl) quinolinium (SPQ) fluorescence measurements in HeLa cells expressing mutated plasmids. The results show that (i) all CF-associated mutants, with one exception, lack functional activity as measured in the SPQ assay, (ii) mutations in NBD1 are more sensitive to the effects of the same amino acid change than are the corresponding mutations in NBD2, (iii) cells transfected with plasmids bearing CF-associated mutations commonly but not exclusively lack mature CFTR, (iv) NBD mutants lacking mature CFTR fail to activate Cl- channels, and (v) the glycosylation of CFTR, per se, is not required for CFTR function. We reason that the structure of NBD1 itself or of the surrounding domains renders it particularly sensitive to mutational changes. As a result, most NBD1 mutants, but only a few NBD2 mutants, fail to mature or lack functional activity. These findings are consistent with the observed uneven distribution of CFTR missense mutations between NBD1 and NBD2 of CF patients.},

Critical questions for the development of gene transfer strategies for CF airway disease are what airway regions require CFTR function and how many epithelial cells require CFTR expression to restore normal ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to CF airway epithelium? An in vitro model of human CF ciliated surface airway epithelium (CF HAE) was used to test whether a human parainfluenza virus (PIV) vector engineered to express CFTR (PIVCFTR) could deliver sufficient CFTR to CF HAE to restore mucus transport, thus correcting the CF phenotype. PIVCFTR delivered CFTR to {\textgreater}60{\%} of airway surface epithelial cells and expressed CFTR protein in CF HAE approximately 100-fold over endogenous levels in non-CF HAE. This efficiency of CFTR delivery fully corrected the basic bioelectric defects of Cl(-) and Na(+) epithelial ion transport and restored ASL volume regulation and mucus transport to levels approaching those of non-CF HAE. To determine the numbers of CF HAE surface epithelial cells required to express CFTR for restoration of mucus transport to normal levels, different amounts of PIVCFTR were used to express CFTR in 3{\%}-65{\%} of the surface epithelial cells of CF HAE and correlated to increasing ASL volumes and mucus transport rates. These data demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that restoration of normal mucus transport rates in CF HAE was achieved after CFTR delivery to 25{\%} of surface epithelial cells. In vivo experimentation in appropriate models will be required to determine what level of mucus transport will afford clinical benefit to CF patients, but we predict that a future goal for corrective gene transfer to the CF human airways in vivo would attempt to target at least 25{\%} of surface epithelial cells to achieve mucus transport rates comparable to those in non-CF airways.},

Does the CFTR actually conduct ATP or does it regulate the conductance of ATP? Recent findings either support or reject the hypothesis that the CFTR can transport ATP. In addition, recent research from several laboratories has suggested that ATP mediates its effects after traversing the plasma membrane and reaching the extracellular surface. The current model suggests that the released ATP exerts its various influences via a purinergic receptor to regulate outwardly rectifying chloride channels and expithelial sodium channels.},

abstract = {The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) Cl channel exhibits lyotropic anion selectivity. Anions that are more readily dehydrated than Cl exhibit permeability ratios (P S/P Cl) greater than unity and also bind more tightly in the channel. We compared the selectivity of CFTR to that of a synthetic anion-selective membrane [poly(vinyl chloride)–tridodecylmethylammonium chloride; PVC-TDMAC] for which the nature of the physical process that governs the anion-selective response is more readily apparent. The permeability and binding selectivity patterns of CFTR differed only by a multiplicative constant from that of the PVC-TDMAC membrane; and a continuum electrostatic model suggested that both patterns could be understood in terms of the differences in the relative stabilization of anions by water and the polarizable interior of the channel or synthetic membrane. The calculated energies of anion–channel interaction, derived from measurements of either permeability or binding, varied as a linear function of inverse ionic radius (1/r), as expected from a Born-type model of ion charging in a medium characterized by an effective dielectric constant of 19. The model predicts that large anions, like SCN, although they experience weaker interactions (relative to Cl) with water and also with the channel, are more permeant than Cl because anion–water energy is a steeper function of 1/r than is the anion–channel energy. These large anions also bind more tightly for the same reason: the reduced energy of hydration allows the net transfer energy (the well depth) to be more negative. This simple selectivity mechanism that governs permeability and binding acts to optimize the function of CFTR as a Cl filter. Anions that are smaller (more difficult to dehydrate) than Cl are energetically retarded from entering the channel, while the larger (more readily dehydrated) anions are retarded in their passage by “sticking” within the channel.},

abstract = {It has been reported recently that the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) besides transcellular chloride transport, also controls the paracellular permeability of bronchial epithelium. The aim of this study was to test whether overexpressing wtCFTR solely regulates paracellular permeability of cell monolayers. To answer this question we used a CFBE41o- cell line transfected with wtCFTR or mutant F508del-CFTR and compered them with parental line and healthy 16HBE14o- cells. Transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and paracellular fluorescein flux were measured under control and CFTR-stimulating conditions. CFTR stimulation significant decreased TER in 16HBE14o- and also in CFBE41o- cells transfected with wtCFTR. In contrast, TER increased upon stimulation in CFBE41o- cells and CFBE41o- cells transfected with F508del-CFTR. Under non-stimulated conditions, all four cell lines had similar paracellular fluorescein flux. Stimulation increased only the paracellular permeability of the 16HBE14o- cell monolayers. We observed that 16HBE14o- cells were significantly smaller and showed a different structure of cell-cell contacts than CFBE41o- and its overexpressing clones. Consequently, 16HBE14o- cells have about 80{\%} more cell-cell contacts through which electrical current and solutes can leak. Also tight junction protein composition is different in 'healthy' 16HBE14o- cells compared to 'cystic fibrosis' CFBE41o- cells. We found that claudin-3 expression was considerably stronger in 16HBE14o- cells than in the three CFBE41o- cell clones and thus independent of the presence of functional CFTR. Together, CFBE41o- cell line transfection with wtCFTR modifies transcellular conductance, but not the paracellular permeability. We conclude that CFTR overexpression is not sufficient to fully reconstitute transport in CF bronchial epithelium. Hence, it is not recommended to use those cell lines to study CFTR-dependent epithelial transport.},

abstract = {The dimerization of their two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) in a so-called "nucleotide-sandwich" is the hallmark of ATP cassette binding (ABC) proteins and the basis of their catalytic activities. The major disease-causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR or ABCC7), deletion of Phe508 in NBD1, does not grossly alter the structure of that domain but prevents conformational maturation of the whole CFTR protein, possibly by disrupting the native interaction between NBD1 and NBD2. However, the role of inter-domain interactions in CFTR folding has been brought into question by a recent report that all CFTR domains fold independently. Here we show that in addition to domain folding, correct inter-domain assembly is essential to form a stable unit that satisfies endoplasmic reticulum (ER) quality control. N-terminal domains depend on their more C-terminal neighbors, most essentially the second membrane-spanning domain (MSD2) but significantly, not NBD2. Wild-type C-terminal truncation constructs, completely devoid of NBD2 are transported out of the ER and to the cell surface where they form characteristic CFTR chloride channels with low open probability. The DeltaNBD2 wild-type protein matures and has similar stability as its full-length counterpart. Therefore, the catalytically crucial inter-NBD associations are not required to satisfy ER quality control mechanisms. The DeltaF508 mutation arrests the maturation of DeltaNBD2 just as it does full-length CFTR, indicating that DeltaF508 perturbs other portions of the molecule in addition to NBD2. We find that the mutation prevents formation of a compact MSD1, reflected in its susceptibility to protease digestion. This perturbation of MSD1 may in turn prevent its normal integration with MSD2. The dispensability of NBD2 in the folding of more N-terminal domains stands in contrast to the known hypersensitivity to proteolysis of NBD2 in the DeltaF508 protein.},

abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is a mechanism, which selectively degrades transcripts carrying premature termination codons (PTCs) and a variety of physiologic transcripts containing NMD-inducing features. In a recent study, we have found variable NMD efficiency among nasal epithelial cells obtained from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. This variability was found for CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) transcripts carrying the W1282X PTC, as well as for several NMD physiologic substrates. Here, we aimed to investigate the possibility that variability in NMD efficiency is a more generalized phenomenon and is not restricted to nasal epithelial cells. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the NMD efficiency of both a CFTR constructs carrying the W1282X PTC and -globin constructs carrying the NS39 PTC, in HeLa and MCF7 cells. Variability in NMD efficiency was found for both constructs between the cells, such that in HeLa cells the NMD was highly efficient and in MCF7 the efficiency was significantly lower. Moreover, similar differences in the efficiency of NMD were found for five endogenous NMD physiologic transcripts. Altogether, our results demonstrate existence of cells in which NMD of all transcripts is efficient, whereas others in which the NMD is less efficient, suggesting that the efficiency of NMD is an inherent character of cells. Our results also suggest that variability in the efficiency of NMD is a general phenomenon and is not restricted to nasal epithelial cells. As NMD affects the level of many transcripts, variability in the NMD efficiency might play a role as a genetic modifier of different cellular functions.},

The clinical manifestations of the disease are caused by defects in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. The discovery of theCFTRgene in 1989 has led to a sophisticated understanding of how thousands of mutations in theCFTRgene affect the structure and function of the CFTR protein. Much progress has been made over the past decade with the development of orally bioavailable small molecule drugs that target defective CFTR proteins caused by specific mutations. Furthermore, there is considerable optimism about the prospect of gene replacement or editing therapies to correct all mutations in cystic fibrosis. The recent approvals of ivacaftor and lumacaftor represent the genesis of a new era of precision medicine in the treatment of this condition. These drugs are having a positive impact on the lives of people with cystic fibrosis and are potentially disease modifying. This review provides an update on advances in our understanding of the structure and function of the CFTR, with a focus on state of the art targeted drugs that are in development.},

abstract = {The relationships among ion current, membrane potential difference, and resistance of an epithelium are studied. The short-circuit technique introduced by Ussing and Zerahn does not com-pletely short circuit the epithelium if the series re-sistance parallel to the cell layer between the voltage electrodes is not properly compensated. The residual potential difference across the epithelial cell layer in the "short-circuit state" is proportional to both the measured short-circuit current and the resistance of the diffusion barriers not compensated. In the con-ventionally short-circuited small intestinal mucosa the villus and crypt areas are hypo-polarized to dif-ferent degrees rather than simultaneously hyper-and hypo-polarized. Short-circuiting the whole tissue re-duces but does not abolish the passive net ion move-ment across the tissue. Measurements of the electri-cal properties of the whole and denuded rat distal small intestine in HCOa-Ringer solution containing 10 mM glucose reveal that the measured short-circuit current has under-estimated approximately 33{\%} of the true short-circuit current and that the passive net Na flux from serosa to mucosa and C1 flux from mucosa to serosa are not negligible in the "short-circuit state." The short-circuit technique introduced by Ussing and Zerahn [8] in their studies of ion transport across isolated frog skin has contributed greatly to the investigation of ion transport across epithelial membranes. The short-circuit conditions are accom-plished by bathing both sides of the tissue with identical solutions in the absence of hydrostatic pressure difference and at the same time adjusting the external current so that the electrical potential difference (PD) across the tissue is zero. Under these conditions, the electrochemical potential of any ion is the same in both solutions and there should be no net movement across the tissue resulting from dif-fusion alone. The finding of a net ion flux in the short-circuit state indicates either that the ion is subject to forces arising from its interaction with other fluxes or that the net flux is a result of {\~{}}176 transport." The short-circuit current, in principle, re-presents the algebraic sum of the net fluxes of all ions whose flows across the tissue cannot be attri-buted solely to differences in electrochemical poten-tial. In short-circuiting a cell layer, the resistance of the solutions, connective tissue, and muscle layers in series with the cell layer between the voltage elec-trodes should be taken into consideration. The true short-circuit current should be the short-circuit cur-rent corrected for the series resistance. In the study of current-voltage relations in the membrane of the giant axon of Loligo, Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz [4] were able to estimate the series resistance either by dividing the time constant determining the de-cline of the capacitative curve by the measured value of the membrane capacity or by the change of the potential difference elicited by a rectangular current pulse, as a function of time. In the field of epithelial transport, only the solution resistance has been com-pensated either manually or automatically [-1, 2]. Recently, Gebhardt and Nell [3] were able to mea-sure the series resistance using a method similar to the second method of Hodgkin, Huxley, and Katz [4] by analyzing the voltage deflection elicited by a rectangular current registered on a storage oscillo-scope. With a different view, Rehm concluded from an equivalent circuit model that the whole in vitro tis-sue rather than the epithelial cell layer should be short-circuited E5]. In this paper, we like to show a simple analytical relationship between the true short-circuit current and the short-circuit current},

abstract = {Background: Ataluren was developed to restore functional protein production in genetic disorders caused by nonsense mutations, which are the cause of cystic fibrosis in 10{\%} of patients. This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of ataluren in patients with nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis. Methods: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 study enrolled patients from 36 sites in 11 countries in North America and Europe. Eligible patients with nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis (aged ≥6 years; abnormal nasal potential difference; sweat chloride {\textgreater}40 mmol/L; forced expiratory volume in 1 s [FEV1] ≥40{\%} and ≤90{\%}) were randomly assigned by interactive response technology to receive oral ataluren (10 mg/kg in morning, 10 mg/kg midday, and 20 mg/kg in evening) or matching placebo for 48 weeks. Randomisation used a block size of four, stratified by age, chronic inhaled antibiotic use, and percent-predicted FEV1. The primary endpoint was relative change in percent-predicted FEV1 from baseline to week 48, analysed in all patients with a post-baseline spirometry measurement. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00803205. Findings: Between Sept 8, 2009, and Nov 30, 2010, 238 patients were randomly assigned, of whom 116 in each treatment group had a valid post-baseline spirometry measurement. Relative change from baseline in percent-predicted FEV1 did not differ significantly between ataluren and placebo at week 48 (-2{\textperiodcentered}5{\%} vs -5{\textperiodcentered}5{\%}; difference 3{\textperiodcentered}0{\%} [95{\%} CI -0{\textperiodcentered}8 to 6{\textperiodcentered}3]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}12). The number of pulmonary exacerbations did not differ significantly between treatment groups (rate ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}77 [95{\%} CI 0{\textperiodcentered}57-1{\textperiodcentered}05]; p=0{\textperiodcentered}0992). However, post-hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients not using chronic inhaled tobramycin showed a 5{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} difference (95{\%} CI 1{\textperiodcentered}5-10{\textperiodcentered}1) in relative change from baseline in percent-predicted FEV1 between the ataluren and placebo groups at week 48 (-0{\textperiodcentered}7{\%} [-4{\textperiodcentered}0 to 2{\textperiodcentered}1] vs -6{\textperiodcentered}4{\%} [-9{\textperiodcentered}8 to -3{\textperiodcentered}7]; nominal p=0{\textperiodcentered}0082), and fewer pulmonary exacerbations in the ataluern group (1{\textperiodcentered}42 events [0{\textperiodcentered}9-1{\textperiodcentered}9] vs 2{\textperiodcentered}18 events [1{\textperiodcentered}6-2{\textperiodcentered}7]; rate ratio 0{\textperiodcentered}60 [0{\textperiodcentered}42-0{\textperiodcentered}86]; nominal p=0{\textperiodcentered}0061). Safety profiles were generally similar for ataluren and placebo, except for the occurrence of increased creatinine concentrations (ie, acute kidney injury), which occurred in 18 (15{\%}) of 118 patients in the ataluren group compared with one ({\textless}1{\%}) of 120 patients in the placebo group. No life-threatening adverse events or deaths were reported in either group. Interpretation: Although ataluren did not improve lung function in the overall population of nonsense-mutation cystic fibrosis patients who received this treatment, it might be beneficial for patients not taking chronic inhaled tobramycin.

abstract = {Background Cystic fibrosis is a life-limiting disease that is caused by defective or deficient cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein activity. Phe508del is the most common CFTR mutation. Methods We conducted two phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies that were designed to assess the effects of lumacaftor (VX-809), a CFTR corrector, in combination with ivacaftor (VX-770), a CFTR potentiator, in patients 12 years of age or older who had cystic fibrosis and were homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation. In both studies, patients were randomly assigned to receive either lumacaftor (600 mg once daily or 400 mg every 12 hours) in combination with ivacaftor (250 mg every 12 hours) or matched placebo for 24 weeks. The primary end point was the absolute change from baseline in the percentage of predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) at week 24. Results A total of 1108 patients underwent randomization and received study drug. The mean baseline FEV1 was 61{\%} of the predicted value. In both studies, there were significant improvements in the primary end point in both lumacaftor-ivacaftor dose groups; the difference between active treatment and placebo with respect to the mean absolute improvement in the percentage of predicted FEV1 ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 percentage points (P{\textless}0.001), which corresponded to a mean relative treatment difference of 4.3 to 6.7{\%} (P{\textless}0.001). Pooled analyses showed that the rate of pulmonary exacerbations was 30 to 39{\%} lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups than in the placebo group; the rate of events leading to hospitalization or the use of intravenous antibiotics was lower in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor groups as well. The incidence of adverse events was generally similar in the lumacaftor-ivacaftor and placebo groups. The rate of discontinuation due to an adverse event was 4.2{\%} among patients who received lumacaftor-ivacaftor versus 1.6{\%} among those who received placebo. Conclusions These data show that lumacaftor in combination with ivacaftor provided a benefit for patients with cystic fibrosis homozygous for the Phe508del CFTR mutation.

abstract = {Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by many types of genetic defects, including premature stop codons. Gentamicin can suppress stop mutations in CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in vitro and in vivo, leading to improvements in CFTR-dependent ion transport and protein localization to the apical surface of respiratory epithelial cells. The primary objective of this study was to test whether nasally administered gentamicin or tobramycin could suppress premature stop mutations in CFTR, resulting in full-length, functional protein. A secondary objective was to obtain data to aid in the design of multicenter trials using the nasal potential difference as a study endpoint. A multicenter study was conducted in two cohorts of patients with CF, those heterozygous for stop mutations in the CFTR gene and those without nonsense mutations, to investigate the effects of both gentamicin and tobramycin administered over a 28-d period on sequential nasal potential difference and airway cell immunofluorescence endpoints. Eleven patients with CF with stop mutations were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, crossover fashion to receive each drug, while 18 subjects with CF without stop mutations were randomized 1:1 in a parallel fashion to receive one drug. After demonstration of drug delivery, neither aminoglycoside produced detectable changes in nasal ion transport or CFTR localization in brushed cells from either study group. These results with first-generation suppressive agents suggest the need for improved drug delivery methods and/or more potent suppressors of nonsense mutations to confer CFTR correction in subjects with CF heterozygous for nonsense mutations. The study provides valuable information on parameters of the nasal potential difference measurements for use in future multicenter clinical trials.},

Thirteen individuals were detected as heterozygotes (six for delta F508 and seven for W1282X), predicting a heterozygote frequency of 1:29. This is similar to the frequency of carriers in the Caucasian population of northern European ancestry. On the basis of these data, the Ashkenazi population is considered to be a candidate for CF heterozygote screening.},

abstract = {Certain aminoglycosides are capable of inducing "translational readthrough" of premature termination codons (PTCs). However, toxicity and relative lack of efficacy deter treatment with clinically available aminoglycosides for genetic diseases caused by PTCs, including cystic fibrosis (CF). Using a structure-based approach, the novel aminoglycoside NB54 was developed that exhibits reduced toxicity and enhanced suppression of PTCs in cell-based reporter assays relative to gentamicin. We examined whether NB54 administration rescued CFTR protein and function in clinically relevant CF models. In a fluorescence-based halide efflux assay, NB54 partially restored halide efflux in a CF bronchial epithelial cell line (CFTR genotype W1282X/F508del), but not in a CF epithelial cell line lacking a PTC (F508del/F508del). In polarized airway epithelial cells expressing either a CFTR-W1282X or -G542X cDNA, treatment with NB54 increased stimulated short-circuit current (I (SC)) with greater efficiency than gentamicin. NB54 and gentamicin induced comparable increases in forskolin-stimulated I (SC) in primary airway epithelial cells derived from a G542X/F508del CF donor. Systemic administration of NB54 to Cftr-/- mice expressing a human CFTR-G542X transgene restored 15-17{\%} of the average stimulated transepithelial chloride currents observed in wild-type (Cftr+/+) mice, comparable to gentamicin. NB54 exhibited reduced cellular toxicity in vitro and was tolerated at higher concentrations than gentamicin in vivo. These results provide evidence that synthetic aminoglycosides are capable of PTC suppression in relevant human CF cells and a CF animal model and support further development of these compounds as a treatment modality for genetic diseases caused by PTCs.},

Here, we report an assessment of optimal culture conditions, the expression pattern of drug-transport-related proteins and the stability/presence of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) mutation in the gene and gene product over multiple passages. The CFBE41o- cell line was also compared with a wild-type airway epithelial cell line, 16HBE14o-, which served as model for bronchial epithelial cells in situ. The CFBE41o- cell line retains at least some aspects of human CF bronchial epithelial cells, such as the ability to form electrically tight cell layers with functional cell-cell contacts, when grown under immersed (but not air-interfaced) culture conditions. The cell line is homozygous for DeltaF508-CFTR over multiple passages in culture and expresses a number of proteins relevant for pulmonary drug absorption (e.g. P-gp, LRP and caveolin-1). Hence, the CFBE41o- cell line should be useful for studies of CF gene transfer or alternative treatment with small drug molecules and for the gathering of further information about the disease at the cellular level, without the need for primary culture.},

abstract = {New drugs are needed to enhance premature termination codon (PTC) suppression to treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis (CF) and other diseases caused by nonsense mutations. We tested new synthetic aminoglycoside derivatives expressly developed for PTC suppression in a series of complementary CF models. Using a dual-luciferase reporter system containing the four most prevalent CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) nonsense mutations (G542X, R553X, R1162X, and W1282X) within their local sequence contexts (the three codons on either side of the PTC), we found that NB124 promoted the most readthrough of G542X, R1162X, and W1282X PTCs. NB124 also restored full-length CFTR expression and chloride transport in Fischer rat thyroid cells stably transduced with a CFTR-G542XcDNA transgene, and was superior to gentamicin and other aminoglycosides tested. NB124 restored CFTR function to roughly 7{\%} of wild-type activity in primary human bronchial epithelial (HBE) CF cells (G542X/delF508), a highly relevant preclinical model with endogenous CFTR expression. Efficacy was further enhanced by addition of the CFTR potentiator, ivacaftor (VX-770), to airway cells expressing CFTR PTCs. NB124 treatment rescued CFTR function in a CF mouse model expressing a human CFTR-G542X transgene; efficacy was superior to gentamicin and exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties, suggesting that in vitro results translated to clinical benefit in vivo. NB124 was also less cytotoxic than gentamicin in a tissue-based model for ototoxicity. These results provide evidence that NB124 and other synthetic aminoglycosides provide a 10-fold improvement in therapeutic index over gentamicin and other first-generation aminoglycosides, providing a promising treatment for a wide array of CFTR nonsense mutations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rescue or correction of CFTR function in native epithelia is the ultimate goal of CF therapeutics development. Wild-type (WT) CFTR introduction and replacement is also of particular interest. Such therapies may be complicated by possible CFTR self-assembly into an oligomer or multimer.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Surprisingly, functional CFTR assays in native airway epithelia showed that the most common CFTR mutant, $\Delta$F508-CFTR ($\Delta$F-CFTR), inhibits WT-CFTR when both forms are co-expressed. To examine more mechanistically, both forms of CFTR were transfected transiently in varying amounts into IB3-1 CF human airway epithelial cells and HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells null for endogenous CFTR protein expression. Increasing amounts of $\Delta$F-CFTR inhibited WT-CFTR protein processing and function in CF human airway epithelial cells but not in heterologous HEK-293 cells. Stably expressed $\Delta$F-CFTR in clones of the non-CF human airway epithelial cell line, CALU-3, also showed reduction in cAMP-stimulated anion secretion and in WT-CFTR processing. An ultimate test of this dominant negative-like effect of $\Delta$F-CFTR on WT-CFTR was the parallel study of two different CF mouse models: the $\Delta$F-CFTR mouse and the bitransgenic CFTR mouse corrected in the gut but null in the lung and airways. WT/$\Delta$F heterozygotes had an intermediate phenotype with regard to CFTR agonist responses in in vivo nasal potential difference (NPD) recordings and in Ussing chamber recordings of short-circuit current (ISC) in vitro on primary tracheal epithelial cells isolated from the same mice. In contrast, CFTR bitransgenic +/- heterozygotes had no difference in their responses versus +/+ wild-type mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Taken altogether, these data suggest that $\Delta$F-CFTR and WT-CFTR co-assemble into an oligomeric macromolecular complex in native epithelia and share protein processing machinery and regulation at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As a consequence, $\Delta$F-CFTR slows WT-CFTR protein processing and limits its expression and function in the apical membrane of native airway epithelia. Implications of these data for the relative health of CF heterozygous carriers, for CFTR protein processing in native airway epithelia, and for the relative efficacy of different CF therapeutic approaches is significant and is discussed.},

abstract = {All eukaryotes possess the ability to detect and degrade transcripts harboring premature signals for the termination of translation. Despite the ubiquitous nature of nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and its demonstrated role in the modulation of phenotypes resulting from selected nonsense alleles, very little is known regarding its basic mechanism or the selective pressure for complete evolutionary conservation of this function. This review will present the current models of NMD that have been generated during the study of model organisms and mammalian cells. The physiological burden of nonsense transcripts and the emerging view that NMD plays a broad and critical role in the regulation of gene expression will also be discussed. Such issues are relevant to the proposal that pharmacological manipulation of NMD will find therapeutic application.},

@article{Rowe2007,
abstract = {Cystic fibrosis results from mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Premature termination codons represent a common minority of CFTR mutations, and are caused by base pair substitutions that produce abnormal stop codons in the coding sequence. Select aminoglycosides induce “translational readthrough” of premature stop codons and have been shown to restore full-length functional protein in a number of preclinical and clinical settings. We studied two well-described premature termination codons found in the distal open reading frame of CFTR, W1282X and R1162X, expressed in polarizing and nonpolarizing cells. Our findings indicate that W1282X CFTR–expressing cells demonstrate significantly greater CFTR activity when overexpressed compared with R1162X CFTR cells, even when truncated protein is the predominant form. In addition, our results show that the combination of stimulated expression and stop codon suppression produces additive effects on CFTR-mediated ion transport. These findings provide evidence that W1282X CFTR exhibits membrane localization and retained chloride channel function after enhanced expression, and suggest that patients harboring this mutation may be more susceptible to CFTR rescue. },

abstract = {The integration of usable and flexible analysis support in modelling environments is a key success factor in Model-Driven Development. In this paradigm, models are the core asset from which code is automatically generated, and thus ensuring model correctness is a fundamental quality control activity. For this purpose, a common approach is to transform the system models into formal semantic domains for verification. However, if the analysis results are not shown in a proper way to the end-user (e.g. in terms of the original language) they may become useless. In this paper we present a novel DSVL called BaVeL that facilitates the flexible annotation of verification results obtained in semantic domains to different formats, including the context of the original language. BaVeL is used in combination with a consistency framework, providing support for all steps in a verification process: acquisition of additional input data, transformation of the system models into semantic domains, verification, and flexible annotation of analysis results. The approach has been validated analytically by the cognitive dimensions framework, and empirically by its implementation and application to several DSVLs. Here we present a case study of a notation in the area of Digital Libraries, where the analysis is performed by transformations into Petri nets and a process algebra. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.
