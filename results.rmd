#screen ASO 

results 
=================
In the canontical model of NMD, if one EJC is downstream of a premature termination codn(dEJC) is sufficient for enhancing NMD. There are potentially three sites. In order to assess the impact of individual dEJC on NMD of cftr-W1282X mRNA, we generated CFTR minigenes with one dEJC site. 
  
  - more detailed description of the minigene design
    - mention the splice sites were enhanced in order to separate effect of ASOs on splicing during the ASO screening process.
    - full one, with WT sequence. 
  - demonstrate they are targeted for NMD.

FOr ASO screening, we designed 15mer MOE ASOs with P=S modification and 5'me-C. For each dEJC site, we designed 19 ASOs. As control ASO, we initially used HBB/MECP2 ASOs. But we can also use scramble ASOs (planned experiment for paper).

Out of the many, the lead ASO for each dEJC can increase minigene expression in a dose-dependent manner.

  - ![image: dose-escalation u2os pYK7](u2os_dr2.png)
  - ![image: dose-escalation u2os pYK8](u2os_dr3.png)
These also increased the minigene protein levels
  - ![image: u2os pYK6 protein validation](u2os_wb1.png)
  - ![image: u2os pYK7 protein validation](u2os_wb2.png)
  - ![image: u2os pYK8 protein validation](u2os_wb3.png)
These ASOs increase the mRNA without affecting NMD substrate SC35 (##not sure if this should be included?)

#validate this ASO? 
Next, we tested whether these lead ASOs can be used for inhibiting endogenous CFTR-W1282X mRNA. We generated DLD1 colon cancer cell line which harbor harbor homozygous W1282X in the endogenous CFTR loci with CRISPR/Cas9. We also obtained 16HBE14o- human brochial airway cells with homozygous CFTR-W1282X mutation through cystic fibrosis foundation's resource sharing program (check MTA) (cell line reference). In both types of cells, cycloheximide inhibited NMD and increased the CFTR-W1282X mRNA about 3 fold. 

1. Initially try cocktail from the aso screening
2. Combination screening for each ASO
3. This NMD inhibition needs all EJC targeting
  - different combinations (qpcr)
  - dose response (qpcr)
  - also in df508 cells, the ASOs don't have any effect (check exactly what data). 
  - (supplement) Also test these in the DLD1 w1282x cells
    - In the wt dld1 cells, the ASOs have no effect

#dependence on NMD, EJC components (no experimental data): 
siRNA against eIF4A3, Magoh, Y14, UPF1, SMG6, UPF2 +/- ASO?

#exon components? double gRNA exon skipping + ASO
If you don't have an ASO binding site, does the ASO combination requirement change? 

#effect of the ASOs on the mRNFA transport (no experimental data)?
nuclear fraction vs cytoplasmic fraction
- NT vs. CHX vs. ASO vs. siUPF1

#effect of the ASOs on the endogenous NMD transcripts
- Identification of endogenous NMD transcripts
- Test ASO's effect on the endogenous NMD transcripts

#functional changes
- ASO cocktail's effect on CFTR-mediated chloride current 
  - on dF508 ()
